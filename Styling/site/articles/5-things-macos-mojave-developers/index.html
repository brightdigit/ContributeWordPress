        <div class="content"><p>[<strong>Apple just announced the upcoming macOS update called Mojave for developers (version 10.14).</strong> The final release date will probably be some time in September or October and it's already creating buzz in the tech world. Here are 5 ways this could affect those with macOS apps already out there:]{style=";"} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/macOS-Mojave-Screenshot.jpg" alt="desktop screenshot of Mojave for developers"/>{.aligncenter .size-full .wp-image-1289 width="1280" height="800"}</p><h1>Phasing Out 32 Bit Support for Applications</h1><p>[64-bit computers have been around for at least 10 years. However, many older applications are still built with only 32-bit support. This means macOS has had to support both 32-bit and 64-bit apps.Until now.]{style=";"} Apple has announced that <strong>Mojave will be the final OS to support 32-bit. </strong>With this change in Mojave for developers, <strong>you have one year to get ready and update your build</strong> for 10.15, the first 64-bit only OS from Apple. Otherwise your ancient 32-bit app will no longer work in the fall of 2019.</p><h1>Enhanced App Permissions in Mojave for Developers</h1><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-13-at-2.57.43-PM.png"/><p>{.aligncenter .size-full .wp-image-1257 width="1560" height="1370"} macOS Mojave now requires your apps to request permission when using the <strong>camera, microphone, or any automation</strong> (i.e. AppleScript and Apple Events). This means if your app uses any of those functionalities, <strong>you'll need to update your code to ask for those permissions as well as handle when permission is not granted.</strong></p><h1>Dark Mode and Mojave</h1><p>[Dark mode is the ability to change UI to use a more <em>light on dark </em>theme. Developers love this and it can look slick as long as apps are built with this in mind.<strong> To take advatange, developers can look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface">Apple's documentation</a> on how to support Dark mode.</strong> For websites, make sure your <a href="https://twitter.com/kkuldar/status/1006208146464002049">background color is set properly</a> and stay up to date on possible queries you can add to your styling to keep it looking good in dark mode.]{style=";"}</p><h1>Safari Privacy Features in Mojave</h1><p>[With Mojave, Safari users will have to start explicitly giving permission for certain websites to track them. If you run a website which is using any sort of tracking or pixel targeting, keep note of these changes. You may have to tweak how you track your user interactions for your site.]{style=";"}</p><h1>UIKit Coming to the Mac</h1><p>[caption id="attachment_1285" align="aligncenter" width="896"]<img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-08-06-at-4.35.30-PM-e1533587827702.png" alt="example of "Marzipan" in action on Mojave"/>{.size-full .wp-image-1285 width="896" height="700"} example of "Marzipan" in action on Mojave with the Stocks app[/caption] [UIKit is the framework for developing the user interface of iPhone and iPad apps. There have been rumors of "Marzipan" a bridge which brings UIKit over to the Mac. ]{style=";"}<a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2018/02/16/macos-development-ios-developers/">In this post on macOS development for iOS developers, we speculated about what "Marzipan" could be.</a> Well t[his year they announced that they will be bringing it to Mac developers... probably next year. They have also given us a preview in Mojave with apps like Home, Stocks, News and Calculator. While we can see the resulting apps, there are still plenty of questions like:]{style=";"}</p><ul><li>[How will these apps look? ]{style=";"}</li><li>[How easy will the framework be to use? ]{style=";"}</li><li>[Will it be easy to build a Mac App and an iOS App at the same time?]{style=";"}</li></ul><p>[For those building macOS Apps right now, this means there is time to prepare your app by:]{style=";"}</p><ul><li>Making sure you are organizing your code to use newer APIs and methodoligies</li><li>Avoid deprecated code and APIs</li><li>Use other frameworks and APIs properly which are available across Apple's platforms such as CoreData, Metal, CoreML, and more...</li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p><strong>With all the new features in Mojave for developers, Apple has given us a roadmap for the first time.</strong> This means we have time till 4Q 2019 to:</p><ul><li>Update macOS apps to <strong>use 64-bit only</strong></li><li><strong>Support Dark Mode</strong> in your UI</li><li><strong>Support Enhanced App Permissions</strong> (camera, microphone, etc...)</li><li><strong>Clean up your architecture</strong> to use cross platform frameworks and APIs properly.</li></ul><p>If you have a spare Mac or a spare partition on your hard drive, go ahead download and try macOS Mojave through the <a href="http://developer.apple.com">developer program</a> or the <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">beta program</a> today.
