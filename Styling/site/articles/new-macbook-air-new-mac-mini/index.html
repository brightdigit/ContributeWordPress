        <div class="content"><p>At <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2018/09/04/empowerapps-show-september-12th-apple-event/">the Apple event on September 12</a>, Apple unveiled new iPhones and the latest Apple Watch. But many people are still hoping for a new Mac Book Air and new Mac Mini. As a result, Apple watchers expect more revelations in October.</p><h2><strong>What is the Mac</strong> Mini?</h2><p>This small desktop computer first came out in 2005, and has not had an update since 2014. It has many great uses, but since it hasn't been updated in four years it is very slow compared to newer machines. It's a small, solid budget system because it doesn't come with peripherals. But now it's ancient and overpriced.</p><h2>Current vs. New Mac Mini</h2><p>Many people use the Mini as part of a home theater system and as a server. Apple TV is good, but it doesn't have as much storage as a Mini, and it's not as flexible. It's common for people to use an app such as Plex to store movies along with the Mini.</p><p>There is also a gap in the market for a Mac server. A Mac Mini would be a reasonable choice as a build server or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/xcode_guide-continuous_integration/">continuous integration server</a> for apps intended for proprietary Apple hardware. A continuous integration server would merge all code changes and verify all tests pass in the background on as many environments needed.</p><p>While there's plenty folks can do on a Linux server, there's still a desire for an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macmini/comments/613r2p/mac_mini_as_a_headless_server/">Apple <em>headless server</em></a>. In other words a machine running in the background with no need for a monitor, and running proprietary Apple processes like AirPrint, AirDrop, and Xcode Server.</p><h2>The State of the MacBook Air</h2><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/goran-ivos-771531-unsplash.jpg" alt="The MacBook Air<br>"/>{.wp-image-1437} :::</p><p>The MacBook Air is in a similar situation as the Mini. It has been around for ages but hasn't been updated. Regardless, it's been particularly popular in enterprise and education markets. We speculate that Apple will either upgrade it or come out with a new, less expensive model.</p><p>In 2015, Apple did come out with the MacBook, which perhaps was Apple's first attempt at replacing the Air. Unfortunately the base price for the cheapest MacBook model is still $1300 - well above the $1000 Air. As a result many customers still buy the MacBook Air. A $1000 MacBook looks like a real market opportunity for both Apple and its customers.</p><p>Despite this opportunity, Apple has some real incentives to hold off on releasing a new Mac Mini or a new Air. Growing the iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch has been a larger priority and taken the lion's share of Apple's development capacity. The Air continues to sell well. And since the parts for it keep getting cheaper, the product's profit margins improve just by changing nothing.</p><h2>Interested in Air or Mini?</h2><p>If you want to purchase an Air or a Mini, we recommending waiting to see what happens in October. If Apple releases new devices, the landscape will change. Be sure to check here and subscribe to<a href="https://www.empowerapps.show/"> our podcast</a> to keep up with the latest news.</p></div>
