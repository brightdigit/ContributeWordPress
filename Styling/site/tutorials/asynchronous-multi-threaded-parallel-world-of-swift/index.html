As an example, lets look at the two independent operations. In this case, we have a pink one which is processing image A and a blue one which is processing image B.</p><h3>Concurrency and Parallelism</h3><p>When these operations are scheduled by the operating system, they can be run <em>concurrently</em>. <strong>Concurrency</strong> means that the operation can be partitioned and run at the same time on the same processor.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/ParallelConcurrency.001-1024x768.jpeg" alt="The Difference Between Concurrency and Paralellism"/>{.wp-image-681 width="1024" height="768"} :::</p><p>In addition, when the operating system has access to multiple processing units or cores, it can also run the operations in <strong>parallel</strong>.

That is to say, by programming these calls synchronously, it will lock up other active operations such as user interface updates. Therefore making these calls asynchronous allows for other operations to be run concurrently. Specifically this is done in Swift, by including a completion closure or code block as a parameter. To put it differently, when the operation is completed that closure is executed on completion with a result passed.</p><p>For instance rather than actively waiting for a download to complete, the API allows the developer to pass what code they want the application to run when the operation is completed. Notably, this allows the operating system to schedule other operations in meantime like updating your UI. With this in mind, let's take a look at the several ways Swift developers already run into this.</p><h2>Where do we run into asynchronous operations? {#asynchronous-current}</h2><p>Swift developers are already taking advantage of concurrency with asynchronous functions in their applications. Primary there are three APIs we commonly see:</p><ul><li>Network Requests</li><li>NotificationCenter</li><li>Timers</li></ul><h3>Network Requests and URLSession</h3><p>Network requests are the most frequent example where asynchronous calls make the most sense. While the developer can call a <code>Data</code> constructor to pull contents from a url, Apple already provides an asynchronous method to do this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> url = <span class="type">URL</span>(string:
 <span class="string">"https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/markdown.txt"</span>)!
<span class="type">URLSession</span>.<span class="property">shared</span>.<span class="call">dataTask</span>(with: url) {
 (data, response, error) <span class="keyword">in</span>
  ...
}.<span class="call">resume</span>()
</code></pre><p>In this example, a <code>URLSessionDataTask</code> is created with a callback which takes in the binary <code>Data</code>, the <code>URLResponse</code>, and possible <code>Error</code>. The API will handle the buffering of data and calculating when the request is complete. Additionally it will do it as a separate operation. As a result, the operating system can run other operations concurrently. Likewise <code>NotificationCenter</code> does this as well.</p><h3>NotificationCenter</h3><pre><code><span class="type">URLSession</span>.<span class="property">shared</span>.<span class="call">dataTask</span>(with: url) { (data, response, error) <span class="keyword">in</span>
  <span class="type">NotificationCenter</span>.<span class="property">default</span>.<span class="call">post</span>(name: notificationDownloaded, object: <span class="keyword">nil</span>)
}.<span class="call">resume</span>()

<span class="type">NotificationCenter</span>.<span class="property">default</span>.<span class="call">addObserver</span>(forName: notificationDownloaded, object: <span class="keyword">nil</span>, queue: .<span class="dotAccess">main</span>) { (notification) <span class="keyword">in</span>
  <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Notification Sent"</span>)
  <span class="type">PlaygroundPage</span>.<span class="property">current</span>.<span class="call">finishExecution</span>()
}

<span class="type">PlaygroundPage</span>.<span class="property">current</span>.<span class="property">needsIndefiniteExecution</span> = <span class="keyword">true</span>
</code></pre><p>In this example, when the download is complete, the application posts a notification to <code>NotificationCenter</code>. Additionally, theres an observer for the notification. Therefore, once the notification is received the Playground prints a message and finishes.</p><h3>Timers</h3><p>The application can take this further by adding a <code>Timer</code>, another asynchronous operation. <code>Timer</code> allows developers to delay or periodically repeat an operation. Once again, the API takes advantage of concurrency rather than locking up the application.</p><pre><code><span class="type">NotificationCenter</span>.<span class="property">default</span>.<span class="call">addObserver</span>(forName: notificationDownloaded, object: <span class="keyword">nil</span>, queue: .<span class="dotAccess">main</span>) { (notification) <span class="keyword">in</span>
  <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Notification Received"</span>)
  <span class="type">Timer</span>.<span class="call">scheduledTimer</span>(withTimeInterval: <span class="number">1.0</span>, repeats: <span class="keyword">false</span>) { <span class="keyword">_ in</span>
    <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Timer Activated"</span>)
    <span class="type">PlaygroundPage</span>.<span class="property">current</span>.<span class="call">finishExecution</span>()
  }
}
</code></pre><p>In this example, the code doesn't print the message as before. Rather, a <code>Timer</code> is initialized with a 1 second delay. Therefore when the time approaches, the Playground prints the message and completes.</p><p>Although these asynchronous abstraction offer a convenient way to optimize your applications, there are problems which do come up. Primarily on iOS, the developer isn't able to prioritize each operation. As a result, this is most noticeable is when the developer attempts to update the user interface.</p><h3>Asynchronous UI Updating with the Main Queue</h3><p>One of the first lessons, developers learn when developing for the iPhone or iPad is necessity to make user interface updates on the main thread or <code>DispatchQueue</code>. Whether it's simply updating a <code>UILabel</code> or a</p><p><code>UITableViewCell</code>, the UI update needs to be on the main</p><p><code>DispatchQueue</code>. Therefore, the operation needs to <em>hop</em> to another queue in order to complete the update to the user interface.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> timerSource = <span class="type">DispatchSource</span>.<span class="call">makeTimerSource</span>(flags: [], queue: .<span class="call">global</span>())
timerSource.<span class="call">setEventHandler</span> {
  <span class="type">DispatchQueue</span>.<span class="property">main</span>.<span class="call">async</span> {
    viewController.<span class="property">label</span>.<span class="property">text</span> = <span class="string">"Timer Activated"</span>
  }
}
timerSource.<span class="call">schedule</span>(deadline: .<span class="call">now</span>() + <span class="number">1.0</span>)

<span class="type">NotificationCenter</span>.<span class="property">default</span>.<span class="call">addObserver</span>(forName: notificationDownloaded, object: <span class="keyword">nil</span>, queue: .<span class="dotAccess">main</span>) { (notification) <span class="keyword">in</span>
  <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Notification Received"</span>)
  timerSource.<span class="call">activate</span>()
}
</code></pre><p>In this example, <code>DispatchSourceTimer</code> is created. <code>DispatchSourceTimer</code> is similar to <code>Timer</code>, however the developer has more control over the priority and the queue. As with the previous <code>Timer</code>, when the</p><p><code>Notification</code> is observed, the <code>Timer</code> is started with a 1 second delay. However since the <code>DispatchSourceTimer</code> is designated for using the <code>global</code> queue, it is nessecary to <em>hop</em> to the <code>main</code></p><p><code>DispatchQueue</code> and update a <code>UILabel</code> with the text <em>Timer Activated</em>. Consequently if this is not done, the user interface will not update correctly. Before I explain further how <code>DispatchQueue</code> and <em>Grand Central Dispatch</em> works, let's breakdown how operating systems schedule operations.</p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-24-at-2.04.19-PM.png?fit=640%2C438&ssl=1" alt="An example of the <em>top</em> command view of processes and threads"/><p>{.wp-image-719}</p><h2>How Operating Systems Handle Operations {#operating-systems}</h2><p>Operating System have two level of controlling operations: Processes and Threads.

A <strong>thread</strong> is a small sequence of instructions within a process which the operating system can schedule individually.

Firstly let's discuss the most direct control of threads and processes and slowly evolve into the more abstract and easy to manage.</p><p>![Original Mac<br>(courtesy of</p><https://www.flickr.com/photos/befuddledsenses/493303884>)](https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/493303884_5c71fbcefb_o.jpg){.wp-image-720}

### Original Apple APIs {#original-apis}

Over the years, Apple has evolved its API for giving developers control
over their operations and their scheduling. At first, the API was pretty
basic and direct but has become increasing developer-friendly and given
more control to the operating system as to how to manage it.

#### Thread Class

Although this may be true, let\'s start by at least touching upon that
most direct API:
**[Thread](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/thread)**
(or NSThread in Objective-C). The Thread class gives the developer
direct access to creating actual threads. Their are two ways to do this:
pass in a closure to the initializer or subclass and override the *main*
method.

Although this API is available, I would recommend against using it
unless you absolutely have to. As you\'ll see, there are better
abstractions which give better control to the operating system and are
easy to maintain for the developer.

#### Process Class (for macOS only)

However there are occasions on the Mac, where you need to run a command
or external application. In that case it\'s best to use
[the](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/process)
**[Process](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/process)**
[class](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/process)
(or NSTask in Objective-C). With the Process class, you provide a url to
the executable and run:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let process = Process()
process.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/bin/ls")
process.terminationHandler = {
  _ in
  PlaygroundPage.current.finishExecution()
}

try process.run()
```

While directly creating threads takes control away from the API and
operating system, I think this is perfectly reasonable. In instances
where a piece of functionality is already available on macOS running
another outside process makes sense. As with many operations, it is
important to make sure it does not interfere with the user experience.
While there\'s the function `waitUnitExit` in order which provides a
synchronous result from the operation, using the property
`terminationHandler`, allows for asynchronous callback. That is to stay,
using `terminationHandler` allows the application to do other operation
as it waits for that process to finish.

### Working with Queues and Asynchronous Operations {#queue-apis}

While the Process and Thread class gives developers direct control,
Apple has introduced more abstract ways of dealing with operations. At
the top of those abstraction is the all important **Grand Central
Dispatch.**

#### Grand Central Dispatch

Grand Central Dispatch is by far the most used API for dealing with
parallelism and concurrency through asynchronous operations. Specially,
the most important class in that API is the **DispatchQueue** class.
DispatchQueue allows for the developer to control the scheduling of
operations. Additionally, the developer can guide some more abstract
aspects regarding how the operating system organizes the operations.

For instance, if we were to count from 0 to 1000 within a Playground in
two different DispatchQueues: the high-priority main queue and the
lower-priority global queue, the code would look like this:

``` {.wp-block-code}
PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true

DispatchQueue.global().async {
  var value = 0
  repeat {
    print("glob", value)
    value += 1
  } while(value < 1000)
}

DispatchQueue.main.async {
  var value = 0
  repeat {
    print("main", value)
    value += 1
  } while(value < 1000)
  PlaygroundPage.current.finishExecution()
}
```

By doing this, we would see the counting for each queue interleaved with
each other:

``` {.wp-block-code}
...
main 947
glob 814
glob 815
main 948
glob 816
main 949
glob 817
main 950
glob 818
main 951
glob 819
main 952
main 953
...
```

In the example above the developer can control the priority or queue of
the code block, however there are more ways we can control the
DispatchQueue through the use of flags, quality of service and
attributes:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let barrierQ = DispatchQueue(label: "barrier", qos: .default, attributes: .concurrent)
…
barrierQ.async{
  markdownFiles.append(text)
}
```

As we can see, we\'ve created our own DispatchQueue and noted that it is
*concurrent*. In other words, while the each operation we add is run in
order, the following operation will not wait for the previous operation
to complete. What must be remembered is that running multiple operations
concurrently can result in what\'s called a **Race Condition**.

##### Dealing with Race Conditions in GCD

A Race Condition is where multiple operations are dependent on a single
changeable object or variable resulting in the possibility in an error.
For instance here\'s an example of a Race Condition issue using the
Thread class API:

``` {.wp-block-code}
func increaseTo(_ max: Int) {
  var next:Int
  repeat {
    next = (items.last ?? 0) + 1
    Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 0.1)
    items.append(next)
  }
  while (next <= max)
}
```

As a result of running this in two separate threads, we could get
something like this:

``` {.wp-block-code}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
10 // 😱 Oh No! 😱
11 // 😢
11 // 😭
```

Luckily Grand Central Dispatch provides two ways of resolving this
through barriers: semaphores and flags.

###### Semaphores in GCD

A great use of the DispatchSemaphore is in the Thread example:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 1)

func increaseTo(_ max: Int) {
  var next:Int
  repeat {
    semaphore.wait()
    next = (items.last ?? 0) + 1
    Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 0.1)
    items.append(next)
    semaphore.signal()
  }
  while (next <= max)
}
```

In this example, we are more or less locking down the reading and
writing to the array so it only can be executing by one thread at a
time. In other words, the operation between `.wait()` and `.signal()` is
executing *atomically*.

###### Barriers using DispatchWorkItemFlags

In contrast, with a DispatchQueue, we can provide a flag to ensure the
`markdownFiles` is accessed *atomically*, we can use the `.barrier`
flag:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let barrierQ = DispatchQueue(label: "barrier", qos: .default, attributes: .concurrent)
…
barrierQ.async(group: nil, qos: .default, flags: .barrier) {
  markdownFiles.append(text)
}
```

##### Organizing Multiple Operations with DispatchGroup

Besides DispatchQueue another great use of Grand Central Dispatch is
**DispatchGroup**. For instance, if you have multiple asynchronous
operations which are not dependent on each other such multiple url
calls, DispatchGroup is perfect. DispatchGroup allows the developer to
track their asynchronous completion as a whole:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let group = DispatchGroup()
let count = 20
var markdownFiles = [String](repeating: "", count: count)

for index in (0..<count) {
  group.enter()
  DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)
  .async {
    markdownFiles[index] =
      try! String(contentsOf: url)
    group.leave()
    print(index)
  }
}
```

In the example above, we create a DispatchGroup. Next, the code
asynchronously downloads 20 markdown files and sets the result in the
array. Markedly, each time `group.enter()` is called when the process
starts and `group.leave()` is called to note that particular operation
is completed. Lastly, the developer can call either `notify` or `wait`
on the DispatchGroup depending on whether to wait asynchronously or
synchronously.

One of the more complex natures of multiple asynchronous operations is
organizing dependencies. Therefore let\'s discuss the next level of
abstraction which specialized in dependencies - OperationQueues.

#### Operation Queues

An older yet more abstract API for dealing with multiple Operations is
the OperationQueue (or NSOperationQueue in Objective-C). A preferred
method for dealing with operations, OperationQueues are fairly to simple
to get started:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let operation = BlockOperation {
  for index in 1...100 {
    print(index)
  }
}
OperationQueue.main.addOperation(operation)
```

In this example, we simply add a BlockOperation to the main queue and it
will automatically start printing out 1 to 100. Most importantly, its
with dependencies where OperationQueue shows their potential:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let operation = BlockOperation {
  for index in 1...100 {
    print(index)
  }
}
let anotherOperation = BlockOperation {
  for index in 101...200 {
    print(index)
  }
}
anotherOperation.addDependency(operation)
OperationQueue.main.addOperation(anotherOperation)
OperationQueue.main.addOperation(operation)
```

In the above example, we add a dependency of one operation (0\...100) to
another (101\...200) to ensure that the counting is in the correct
order. As a result, regardless of the order of how the operations are
added, dependent operation is executed first. For this reason, the
developer can add operations in whatever fashion as long as their
dependencies are setup beforehand.

##### Problems with OperationQueue

While dependency management is easier with OperationQueues, there a
couple of issues which showcase it\'s dated Objective-C outlook.
Firstly, there is no native method for doing asynchronous operations in
the Operation (or BlockOperation) class. In other words, the developer
must subclass the Operation and optimize the code for asynchronous
operations or convert the underlying method to an synchronous method.
Secondly, there is no native way to deal with results or errors of each
operation. Therefore, the developer must handle the result of each
operation outside of the operation.

Instead a more modern and functional method for handling asynchronous
methods and their results or errors comes in the form of Promises and
Futures.

:::

### Promises and Futures of Better Asynchronous APIs {#promise-future}

While Apple provides some abstractions for asyncronous operations, Swift
developer will often run into the dreaded *callback hell*

``` {.wp-block-code}
doThis{
  thenThis{
  andThenThis{
    lastlyThis{
      }
  }
  }
}
```

This awful mess of code can be difficult to manage especially when
catching error and dealing with various logic. As much as closures are
superior to Objective-C code blocks, other programming languages such as
JavaScript and C\# have improved on this with the concept of *promises*
and *futures*. In short, where a synchronous function returns a value,
this abstraction allows for the returning of a *promised future* value.

``` {.wp-block-code}
let thatPromise = doThis(...)
let thenThisPromise = thatPromise.then(thenThis)
let andThenThisPromise = thenThisPromise.then(andThenThis)
let lastPromise = andThenThisPromise.then(lastlyThis)
```

Therefore, let's take a look at a couple of Swift libraries: SwiftNIO
and Google's Promise library.

#### SwiftNIO - Asynchronous on the Server

While Swift\'s largest focus has been on the iPhone, it is important to
note that the server is where asynchronous operations often occur.
Whether the server is making HTTP calls to the outside or accessing a
database, it has to wait for the completion of network requests.
Therefore, it's no wonder that SwiftNIO the backbone of the main
server-side frameworks, Kitura and Vapor, employs its own Promise and
Future infrastructure. While server-side Swift mostly uses SwiftNIO,
Apple devices such as the iPhone can also use the package.

``` {.wp-block-code}
public func setupSite(_ site: Site, withTheme theme: Theme, _ completed: @escaping (Error?) -> Void)

public func setupSite(_ site: Site, withTheme theme: Theme, using eventLoop: EventLoop) -> EventLoopFuture<Site> {
  let promise = eventLoop.makePromise(of: Site.self)
  eventLoop.execute {
    self.setupSite(site, withTheme: theme) { error in
      if let error = error {
        promise.fail(error)
      } else {
        promise.succeed(site)
      }
    }
  }

  return promise.futureResult
}
```

In this example, there is an asynchronous function which sets up a
website based on a theme. Namely, this function takes as parameters, the
site, the theme, and a closure which takes in an `Error` if the
operation failed. Given that, for the purpose of using Futures, there is
a new method which returns SwiftNIO's `Future` or `EventLoopFuture` with
the resulting `Site` object.

Notably, in Swift, some sort of queue, thread, or loop must be specified
in order to assign where the operation will be executed. Likewise,
SwiftNIO uses the `EventLoop` to designate where the operation will be
executed. Therefore, from the `EventLoop`, an `EventLoopPromise` is
created. Next, from the `EventLoop` a closure is passed where the
original asynconous `setupSite` function is called. From inside the
closure, a success or failure state on the promise is set using `.fail`
and `.succeed`. Lastly, the promise has a property which contains the
*future* using `.futureResult`.

``` {.wp-block-code}
let future = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme, using: eventLoop)
future.whenComplete {
  ...
}
```

In most cases, the `EventLoop` is accessed from originating
`HTTPRequest` or `Application`. In any case, to call our `Future`
returning function and do something with the value, `whenComplete` to
set the callback on the resulting operation.

##### Functional Programming in SwiftNIO

The other advantage of *promises* and *futures*, is being able to apply
functional programming concepts to *future* results.

``` {.wp-block-code}
let futureSite = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme, using: eventLoop)
// returns a Future<String>
let futureString = futureSite.map{
  $0.name
}

// flatMap "flattens" the Future<Future<String>> to just
// Future<String>
let futureHTML = futureSite.flatMap{
  // return Future<String>
   promise(fromAsyncLoadingSite: $0)
}

let sites: [Future<Site>]
// flatten "flattens" [Future<String>] to Future<[String]>
let siteNamesFuture = sites.map{ site in site.map{
  $0.name
}.flatten(using: eventLoop)

let nameAndHTML : Future<(String, String)> = futureString.and(futureHTML)
```

Therefore, with SwiftNIO:

-   `.map`\
    -   converts `Future<A>` to `Future<B>` by
    -   taking in a closure of type: `(A) -> (B)`
-   `.flatMap`\
    -   converts `Future<A>` to `Future<B>` by
    -   taking in a closure of type: `(A) -> (Future<B>)`
-   `.flatten`\
    -   converts `[Future<A>]` to `Future<[A]>` by
    -   taking in an `EventLoop`
-   `.and`\
    -   on `Future<A>` and takes in a `Future<B>` **or** `B`
    -   returns a `Future` tuple of type `Future<(A,B)>`

Unfortunately since network operation and server-side communication are
at the center of SwiftNIO, the only way currently to create an
`EventLoop` on iOS is by using a `MultithreadedEventLoopGroup`:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let pool = MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup(numberOfThreads: 5)
let eventLoop = pool.next()
```

However, a better library to implement *promises* on iOS (and other
client devices) is Google's own *Promise* framework.

#### [Google Promises](https://github.com/google/promises) - Asynchronous on the Client

While Apple makes SwiftNIO and it contains a great implementation of
*Futures* and *Promises*, it is focuses on server-side and networking
related implementation. However, on the client, Google Promises might be
amongst the best *Promise* APIs for Swift.

``` {.wp-block-code}
public func setupSite(_ site: Site,
  withTheme theme: Theme,
  on queue: DispatchQueue = .main) -> Promise<Site> {
  return Promise<Site>(on: queue) { success, failure in
    self.setupSite(site, withTheme: theme) { error in
      if let error = error {
        failure(error)
      } else {
        success(site)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

While SwiftNIO required the proprietary `EventLoop`, **Google Promises**
requires the familiar `DispatchQueue`. Therefore to create a `Promise`
oriented version of `setupSite`, the function needs a `DispatchQueue`
parameter and needs to return a `Promise` on that `DispatchQueue` with a
closure that calls either `success` or `failure` depending on the
result. Therefore to call the method, the code needs to pass a
`DispatchQueue` and on the `Promise` call `.then` to use the result.

``` {.wp-block-code}
let futureSite = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme, on: .main)
// returns a Promise<String>
let futureString = futureSite.then{
  $0.name
}

// returns a Promise<String>
let futureHTML = futureSite.then{
  // return Promise<String>
   promise(fromAsyncLoadingSite: $0)
}

let sites: [Promise<Site>]
// `all` "flattens" [Promise<String>] to Future<[Promise]>
let siteNamesFuture = all(sites.then{ site in
  site.map{
    $0.name
  }
)

let nameAndHTML : Promise<(String, String)> = all(futureString, futureHTML)
```

##### Functional Programming in Google Promise

Additonally while SwiftNIO differentiated `.map`, `.flatMap`, and
`.whenComplete`, **Google Promise** simplifies it into `.then`:

-   `.then`
    -   converts `Promise<A>` to `Promise<B>` by
    -   taking in a closure of type:
        -   `(A) -> (B)` or
        -   `(A) -> (Promise<B>)`
-   `all`
    -   converts `[Promise<A>]` to `Promise<[A]>` or
    -   converts `(Promise<A>, Promise<B>, …)` into `Promise<(A,B,…)>`

Additionally, Google Promises also has a specific method for dealing
with Error or failure states:

-   `.catch`
    -   a `Void` method which takes a closure of type: `(Error) -> Void`

As a result to fulfill a `Promise`, use either `then` and `catch` or
`fulfill` and `reject`:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let future = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme, on: .main)
future.fulfill {
  // on success
  ...
}.reject{
  // on error
  …
}
```

#### [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit) - Popular Alternative

The most popular alternative for Swift and Objective-C is PromiseKit by
Max Howell. PromiseKit uses a more English-like syntax then the previous
examples.

``` {.wp-block-code}
public func setupSite(_ site: Site,
  withTheme theme: Theme) -> Promise<Site> {
  return Promise<Site>{ resolver in
    self.setupSite(site, withTheme: theme) { error in
      if let error = error {
        resolver.reject(error)
      } else {
        resolver.fulfill(success)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

While you can specify the `DispatchQueue`, with PromiseKit [it\'s
typically not
necessary](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/blob/master/Documentation/FAQ.md#how-do-i-change-the-default-queues-that-handlers-run-on).
Promises use a `Resolver` which has methods which can take variety of
combinations for success or failure including a Result object. Similar
to Google Promises, you can call `.then` to make another asynchronous
call or `.map` for a synchronous mapping.

``` {.wp-block-code}
let futureSite = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme)
// returns a Promise<String>
let futureString = futureSite.map{
  $0.name
}

// returns a Promise<String>
let futureHTML = futureSite.then{
  // return Promise<String>
   promise(fromAsyncLoadingSite: $0)
}

let sites: [Promise<Site>]
// `all` "flattens" [Promise<String>] to Future<[Promise]>
let siteNamesFuture = when(sites.map{ site in
  site.map{
    $0.name
  }
)

let nameAndHTML : Promise<(String, String)> = when(futureString, futureHTML)
```

##### Functional Programming in PromiseKit

Similar to SwiftNIO, PromiseKit differentiates between synchronous and
asynchronous mappings:

-   `.map`
    -   converts `Promise<A>` to `Promise<B>` by
    -   taking in a closure of type: `(A) -> (B)`
-   `.then`
    -   converts `Promise<A>` to `Promise<B>` by
    -   taking in a closure of type: `(A) -> (Promise<B>)`
-   `when`
    -   converts `[Promise<A>]` to `Promise<[A]>` or
    -   converts `(Promise<A>, Promise<B>, …)` into `Promise<(A,B,…)>`

Additionally, similar to Google Promises, PromiseKit has two ways of
handling errors:

-   `.catch`
    -   a `Void` method which takes a closure of type: `(Error) -> Void`
-   `.recover`
    -   a `Promise<T>` method which takes a closure of type:
        `(Error) -> Promise<T>`

As a result to fulfill a `Promise`, use `done` and `catch`:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let future = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme)
future.done {
  // on success
  ...
}.catch{
  // on error
  …
}
```

However while *Promises* and *Future* are certainly a better way to
avoid *callback hell*, there are recent updates which emphasis the
important of user interface responsive. That is to say rather functional
emphasis on optimal operations, this emphasizes the reactive nature of
UI development: **Combine**

### Combine-ing It All Together {#combine}

With **SwiftUI**, Apple has snuck in a whole other framework for
managing asynchronous tasks: **Combine**. With **Combine**, Apple is
introducing an asynchronous model more reflecting the
Subscriber-Publisher model used in reactive programming.

#### Reactive UI Focused Asynchronous Operations

While Promises and Futures handle how to deal with the results of
asynchronous operations, Combine focuses on reacting to multiple changes
in multiple locations. For instance, a Publisher issues changes to data
and a Subscriber listens to the those changes. Therefore SwiftUI becomes
the ideal use case for using Combine with data changes. For instance, if
we have a SwiftUI View which displays the header from a downloaded
markdown file:

``` {.wp-block-code}
struct ContentView: View {
  @ObservedObject var nameObject: ContentObject
  
  var body: some View {
    Text(nameObject.name)
  }
}
```

In this case, this SwiftUI View contains a ObservedObject with a name
property, which is the name or header of the ContentObject. Therefore,
let's take a look at the content object:

``` {.wp-block-code}
class ContentObject: ObservableObject {
  let publisher : AnyPublisher<String, Never>
  var cancellable : AnyCancellable!
  @Published var name : String = "" {
    willSet {
      objectWillChange.send()
    }
  }
  
  static fileprivate func markdownTitlePublisher(fromURL url: URL) -> AnyPublisher<String, Never> { … }
  
  init () {
    self.publisher = ContentObject.markdownTitlePublisher(fromURL: ContentObject.url)
    self.cancellable = self.publisher.receive(on: DispatchQueue.main).sink{ self.name = $0 }
  }
}
```

In this instance, there is an initializer which creates the publisher
for the markdown file's `h1` name . Inside the initializer, we create a
publisher for the name, followed by setting up the assignment of the
result to the name property. Firstly, it creates the publisher. Next,
similar to before with UIKit updates, the code tells the publisher that
it must receive the changes on the main DispatchQueue. Lastly, it tells
the publisher to assign the value to the name property on self. With the
initializer, the code has setup the publisher for the `name` of the
content, a cancellable for the publisher assignment, and the
`@Published` property of the name. Therefore, let's breakdown how the
publisher is created in `ContentObject.markdownTitlePublisher(forURL:)`:

``` {.wp-block-code}
static fileprivate func markdownTitlePublisher(fromURL url: URL) -> AnyPublisher<String, Never> {
  return URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url).tryMap { (arg: URLSession.DataTaskPublisher.Output) throws -> String  in
    let (data, _) = arg
    let text = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
    guard let value = text?.components(separatedBy: .newlines).first else {
      throw InvalidTextError()
    }
    return value
  }.catch({ (error) in
    return Just(nil)
  }).compactMap{ $0 }.eraseToAnyPublisher()
}
```

##### Functional Programming with Combine

Luckily, Combine provides already built-in methods for publishers for
the three main asynchronous APIs, which I talked about previously:
NotificationCenter, Timer, and URL tasks. In this case, let's look at
how URL Task publisher transforms to useable String value for the name
property:

1.  `tryMap` reads the first line of text by decoding the binary `data`
    into text and reading the first line.
2.  `catch` converts the useless error into nil\...\
    **For a SwiftUI View to use a publisher, the publisher must always
    handle the error in order to assign the value.**
3.  `compactMap` removes any nil values from the publisher pipeline
4.  `eraseToAnyPublisher` uses type erasure to remove the specifics
    conversions taken place.

Therefore, with all the plumbing in place, SwiftUI and Combine will
display the display the first line of the markdown file.

In conclusion, Combine really shows it's power when it comes to UI
updates (not just SwiftUI but UIKit, AppKit, etc...) and any situation
where reactive programming makes sense such as when there are multiple
publishers and subscribers. However if you are comfortable with Promises
and Futures and your code is more simple and straightforward it's
perfectly reasonable to go with that method.

### Coroutines - The Future of Asynchronous Operations {#coroutines}

Before closing out, there has been proposals for making Promises and
Futures native in Swift along with the syntactic sugar some common in
other languages known as **Coroutines**. (Read more about **Coroutines**
in [Chris Latner's
proposal](https://gist.github.com/lattner/429b9070918248274f25b714dcfc7619).)
Let's take a look at our earlier example:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let url = URL(string:
 "https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/markdown.txt")!
URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) {
 (data, response, error) in
  …
}.resume()
```

In this case, a closure is based as a parameter along with a task.
However a Promise or Future might look something like this:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let url = URL(string:
 "https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/markdown.txt")!
let promise : Future<(Data?, HttpResponse?, Error?)> = URLSession.shared.data(with: url) 
```

With syntactic sugar like `async` and `await`, it become even cleaner
with:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let url = URL(string:
 "https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/markdown.txt")!
let response = await URLSession.shared.data(with: url) 
```

To declare a method as being asynchronous and wrap a previous method
(using a `callbackWrap` method for now) such as `setupSite` previously:

``` {.wp-block-code}
public func setupSite(_ site: Site, withTheme theme: Theme) async throws -> Site {
  return await callbackWrap { continuation in
  self.setupSite(site, withTheme: theme) { error in

      if let error = error {
        continuation(error)
      } else {
        continuation(site)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With `async` and `await` along with `Combine`, Swift can really take
advantage of asynchronous programming both from the simple
Promise/Future mindset as well as the Reactive programming paradigm.

## What's the Right Toolset?

In conclusion, developers have some key decisions when it comes to the
best way to deal with asynchronous, parallelism, and concurrency:

-   Take Advantage of Your Hardware - make sure not to lock down the
    whole device or application with one thread but allow for many
    actions to take place simultaneously
-   Avoid Convoluted Logic in favor of Easy Maintenance - make it easier
    for the *next* developer to update your code, don't over optimize
    without componentizing
-   Provide Fast UI Experience over a Speedier Logic - giving healthy
    feedback to the user of what's going on is more important than a
    faster application - again avoid freezing your app and device
-   Use Abstractions As Much As Possible - unless you are into highly
    processor intense applications - use Apple's provided abstractions
    (i.e. Combine, etc..) rather lower-level direct APIs (i.e. Threads)
-   Avoid Callback Hell with Promises and Futures - for simple non-UI
    code use Promises and Futures to organize multiple asynchronous
    calls as opposed to a pyramid of callbacks
-   For UIs on the latest Operating Systems (iOS 13, watchOS 6, tvOS 13,
    Catalina) use Combine - Combine gives the OS better control of the
    flow multiple asynchronous operations using reactive patterns

Hopefully this article gives you more guidance on how to better manage
multiple operations and optimize your application for a better user
experience. I am looking forward to even better APIs with Swift in the
future.
