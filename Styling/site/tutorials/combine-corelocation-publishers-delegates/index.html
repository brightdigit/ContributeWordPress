}

    return Just(CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus())
      .merge(with:
        authorizationSubject.compactMap { $0 }
      ).eraseToAnyPublisher()
  }
  func locationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<[CLLocation], Never> {
    return locationSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
  }
  func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
    locationSubject.send(locations)
  }
  func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didFailWithError _: Error) {
    // Implement to avoid crashes
    // Extra Credit: Create a publisher for errors :/
  }
  func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didChangeAuthorization status: CLAuthorizationStatus) {
    authorizationSubject.send(status)
  }
}
```


Let‚Äôs breakdown how this class works.


## The Power of Type Erasing Publishers


Our Publicist doesn‚Äôt need to hold onto any values. In the end, it solely serves the purpose of transforming data from the CoreLocationManager to the ObservableObject. For this reason, we‚Äôll be using a PassthroughSubject for the CLLocation and CLAuthorizationStatus. That is to say, PassthroughSubject doesn't hold any values as they receive values but passes them on. 



With the PassthroughSubject properties in place, our delegate can send the values received from the delegate methods to the subjects. 



Creating our first publisher for CLLocation is fairly simple:


```swift
class CLLocationManagerPublicist: NSObject, CLLocationManagerCombineDelegate {
...
  let locationSubject = PassthroughSubject<[CLLocation], Never>()
  func locationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<[CLLocation], Never> {
    return locationSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
  }
  func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
    locationSubject.send(locations)
  }
...
}
```


What‚Äôs important to realize is that we need to implement type erasure using eraseToAnyPublisher. The introduction of SwiftUI and Combine included improvements to Swift. These improvement allow for powerful transformations which can result in fairly complex Generic Types. For instance our authorizationPublisher has a return type AnyPublisher: 


```swift
  func authorizationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never> {
    return Just(CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus())
      .merge(with:
        authorizationSubject.compactMap { $0 }
      ).eraseToAnyPublisher()
  }
```


Without eraseToAnyPublisher, the return type would be:


```swift
Publishers.Merge<Just<CLAuthorizationStatus>, Publishers.CompactMap<PassthroughSubject<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never>, CLAuthorizationStatus>>
```


Likewise with the locationPublisher, the return type would be:


```swift
PassthroughSubject<[CLLocation], Never>
```


In the end, this makes creating Protocols and Return Types fairly complex. As far as the ObservableObject is concerned, it doesn‚Äôt care how the publisher is transformed but the result types returned. 



Therefore our Protocol only needs a AnyPublisher return type. In the end, we can both simplify and hide the method of functional transformation using eraseToAnyPublisher. Likewise, the implementation calls eraseToAnyPublisher to reduce the return type and match the Protocol's method signature. 



Now that we have figured out how to creating matching Publisher types, let‚Äôs transform CLAuthorizationStatus so it is usable within the view.


## Transforming Authorization Status into a Publisher


While our locationSubject reflects the values from CoreLocation, the authorizationSubject will be out of sync from the reality of CoreLocation‚Äôs status. For this reason, we‚Äôll need to write some code include the initial status along with whatever the PassthroughSubject receives.


```swift
  func authorizationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never> {
    return Just(CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus())
      .merge(with:
        authorizationSubject
      ).eraseToAnyPublisher()
  }
```


While CoreLocationManagerDelegate sends updates to authorizationStatus, we need to have access to the initial status via CLLocationManager.authorizedStatus. Luckily, Combine includes a built-in Publisher for single values using Just. 



Just gives us the initial value published however we need to include the remaining published values from our PassthroughSubject. For this reason, we can use merge to join the intial value with the result from the our authorizationSubject:







We have the publisher factories setup now!


## What's Next?


In our next part in this series, we'll learn how to use this implementation in our ObservableObject CoreLocationObject. Specifically, we'll be getting into power of function programming within Reactive Functional Programming. Enjoy!</p></div>
