        <div class="content"><p>I have to say I had a great time at <a href="https://www.tryswift.co/events/2018/nyc/">try!Swift New York</a> this year. I have been to many developer conferences over the years but lately I have been attending mostly business and startup conferences (i.e. <a href="https://www.microconf.com">MicroConf</a> and <a href="https://releasenotes.tv">Release Notes</a>).</p><p>Additionally, this is the first Apple developer conference I have ever attended as opposed toÂ <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-CocoaHeads/">hosting</a>, attending, and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/A2-CocoaHeads/events/246212307/">speaking</a> at a Cocoaheads groups. This was a new environment.</p><p>I wanted to get a feel of where the winds are blowing in Swift and there were some interesting trends to the topics presented:</p><h2>ARKit and CoreML</h2><p>Big surprise right! ðŸ™ƒ</p><p>Apple has been showcasing and backing these technologies for a while. Except for my occasional attempts at creating models, I haven't been doing enough in this area and these talks reinforce my need to do so.Â <a href="https://twitter.com/tryswiftnyc">Aileen Nielsen</a> really broke down how Machine Learning works. <a href="https://twitter.com/bertadevant">Berta Devant</a> explained how ARKit does face tracking and can be used.Â <a href="https://twitter.com/mataharimau">Audrey Tam</a>Â explained how to build your own model using Apple's new tools. <a href="https://twitter.com/kenmaz">Kentaro Matsumae</a>Â showed a great application using his <em>Super Resolution</em> technique. Overall the need to invest time in Machine Learning technology will continue to grow.</p><h2>Swift on the Server</h2><p>Swift on the server is real and there is real corporate backing to it. I happen to attend the workshop by IBM on <a href="https://www.kitura.io">Kitura</a> and got a glimpse of how to develop and deploy with Docker and Kubernetes.Â <a href="https://twitter.com/gopalkri">Gopal Sharma</a>Â spoke about the challenges he's faced with Swift on the server.Â <a href="https://twitter.com/johannesweiss">Johannes Weiss</a>Â spoke about <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-nio">SwiftNIO</a> which is the future of client and server side communication.Â <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris__Bailey">Chris Bailey</a>Â &amp;Â <a href="https://twitter.com/alfa">Ian Partridge</a>Â went into detail of Kitura's deployment process and its future and <a href="https://twitter.com/logmaestro">Logan Wright</a> spoke about <a href="https://vapor.codes">Vapor</a>.</p><p>If companies continue to adopt Vapor and Kitura, we'll continue to see growth in that space. It's something Swift developers should seriously spend some time understanding.</p><h2>Podcasting</h2><p>Podcasts continue to be a growing area. I am the host of two podcasts:Â <a href="https://okproductive.com">OkProductive</a> and <a href="https://www.empowerapps.show">EmpowerApps.Show</a>. I have followed podcast networks like <a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay Fm</a> and <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com">Gimlet</a>, as well as software creators like <a href="https://transistor.fm">Marco Arment</a> and <a href="https://transistor.fm">Justin Jackson</a>. So it was really interesting to seeÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/leahculver">Leah Culver</a>Â from Breaker talk about their story and what she's learned about growing a software company. It'll be interesting to see what other startups flourish in this new industry.</p><h2>Other Topics...</h2><p>Other Swift topics which were of interest to me included:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/ChristinaMltn">Christina Moulton</a>Â talking about <strong>Siri Shortcuts</strong></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/atomicbird">Tom Harrington</a>Â on <a href="https://halide.cam">Core Data in Swift</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/KrauseFx">Felix Krause</a>Â from <a href="https://fastlane.tools">Fastlane</a> on trusting 3rd-party SDKs</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/steipete">Peter Steinberger</a>Â on hacking Marzipan (i.e. using UIKit to build Mac Apps)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kthomas901">Kaya Thomas</a>Â on building advanced notifications</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/sdw">Sebastiaan de With</a>Â on building delightful user interfaces at Apple and now with <a href="https://halide.cam">Halide</a></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>try!Swift was a great conference and a great opportunity to meet a lot of great people in the Swift space. If you are in the Swift space, especially a beginner, I would definitely recommend checking it out.</p></div>
