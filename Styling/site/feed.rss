In this article we'll talk about getting started:</p><ul><li>using a package in Xcode</li><li>creating a package in Xcode or with the <code>swift</code> command</li><li>how the manifest Package.swift file for your Swift Package works</li></ul><h2>Using a Package in Your App</h2><p>There are two ways to get started using Swift Package Manager for your project in Xcode.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Untitled-17069-1-825x1024.gif"/><p>{.wp-image-1154}</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2020-10-19-17067-1006x1024.png"/><p>{.wp-image-1155}</p><p>First, you can simply drag the folder into your Xcode project. This is the ideal way, when you are planning on working on the Xcode project while working on its dependent Swift Package. Otherwise, you can add the package dependency within the file menu in Xcode.</p><h2>Creating a Package</h2><p>Xcode also allows you to create a new package. You can do this by going to file new and Swift package to create a package in Xcode.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2020-11-02-at-5.23.03-PM-14359.png"/><p>{.wp-image-1157 width="274" height="353"}</p><p>Besides Xcode, you can also create one via the command line as well. Assuming you have Xcode or Swift installed on your machine, you could simply run:</p><pre><code>&gt; mkdir <span class="type">New</span>-<span class="type">Package</span>
&gt; swift package <span class="keyword">init</span>
</code></pre><p>By default, it'll use the directory name for the name of your package. Otherwise you can customize the name with the command line option</p><p><code>--name</code>. Additionally you can also specify the type of package you want with the option <code>--type</code>. By default it'll use the library package type. When it creates a library package, it'll create the Package.swift file, the sources directory as well as one for your tests. If you create an executable, it will create a main dot Swift for your executable to run.</p><p>Either Xcode or the Swift command line will create the necessary files and directories to get started.</p><p>In the end, you should have:</p><ul><li>Source directory for your main source code</li><li>Tests directory for your testing suite</li><li>Package.swift, the core of every Swift package</li></ul><h2>Package.swift - Anatomy of a Manifest File</h2><p>The main piece that specifies the configuration of your package is the Package. swift file. Let's take a look at the anatomy of this special file</p><h3>swift tools version</h3><p>At the very top, we see it specifies the Swift tools version this package requires. If you want to support some of the newer features like binary targets or newer operating systems, you're going to have to specify a newer version of Swift. Otherwise you can always use the minimum version required.</p><h3>A Package <em>Instance</em></h3><p>At its core, the <code>Package.swift</code> is a Swift file and therefore contains Swift code for describing the package. Therefore you need to import the PackageDescription module, which is built in.</p><p>From here we can begin to describe the package by creating an instance of a package object inside. The first required parameter for our package is the name followed by our package's dependencies.</p><h3>Defining Dependencies</h3><p>Now let's talk about how to dependencies are defined in a Package.swift file. Typically there 3 components:</p><ul><li>the name of the dependency</li><li>The git url or local path of the dependency - if you intend to work on the dependencies simultaneously you'll need to use a local path</li><li>the version number or some sort of git reference</li></ul><p>In all cases some sort version is required for all dependencies. There are multiple ways to specify the version you want. Most involve the semver numbering system.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Untitled-2-1024x512.png" alt="Components of SemVer"/>{.wp-image-1160} :::</p><h4>How SemVer in Dependencies work</h4><p>There are typically three components: major, minor, and patch. For instance with the string "4.0.1":</p><ul><li>Major is 4</li><li>Minor is 0</li><li>Patch is 1</li></ul><p>In most cases, you'll want to just use the semver string which is automatically resolved up to the next major version based on the repository's available tags.</p><p>If you wish to be more specific about the version you wish to use, there are enumerations available to you to do just that.</p><ul><li><code>upToNextMajor</code> is which equivalent to just using a string will search for tags from the version to the next major version, so 4.0.1 resolves from 4.0.1 to 5.0.0 but not including</li><li><code>upToNextMinor</code> will search for tags from the version to the next minor version, so 4.0.1 resolves from 4.0.1 to 4.1.0 but not including</li><li><code>exact</code> will search for tags with the exact version number only</li></ul><p>Not only can use a semver string but you can specify a branch or revision hash as well. However in most cases, the practice is to use just the semver string which is equivalent to <code>upToNextMajor</code>.</p><h3>Targets and Products</h3><p>Targets are the building blocks of your Swift package. Your targets will reference a set of Swift files which will be compiled into a module or test suite. There are four targets you should know about:</p><ul><li><code>target</code> - a set of code to be used in a library (or main target in executable if swift-tools-version 5.3 or older)</li><li><code>testTarget</code> - a set of code to be used in a test suite</li><li><code>binaryTarget</code> - an compiled binary XCFramework</li><li><code>executableTarget</code> - a set of code to be used as the main target (i.e. <code>main</code> entry point) in a executable for swift tools version 5.4 and newer</li></ul><p>Targets can refers to other targets in the same package as dependencies. Additionally with our dependencies defined in this file, we can access their products as well. Specifically, we can refer to the products of those dependencies in our target's dependencies. Once that's done, we can access that dependency's API in our code. In most cases you can simply use a string referring to product name of the dependency. However in same instance you need to specify the source package using the static func <code>Target.Dependency.product</code>.</p><p>If we want our executable or library available outside of the package, we need to define products in our Package.swift file as well. In this case, there are only two types of products: executable or library. Both require parameters for name and targets it contains. Additionally with libraries you can specify whether your library should static or dynamically linked.</p><p>To clarify the differences between products and targets:</p><ul><li>Targets are internal; Products are external (i.e. available to anyone)</li><li>Targets can depend on other targets; products can contain multiple targets; targets can depend on dependency products</li></ul><p>Typically you'll have one product per target as well as a test target for your product. In more complex packages such as <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Package.swift">the SPM package itself</a>, you can see how multiple targets are organized and used.</p><h2>More Resources</h2><p>If you are interested in learning more about the <em>Package.swift</em> file, check these resources out:</p><ul><li><a href="https://theswiftdev.com/the-swift-package-manifest-file/"><strong>The Swift package manifest file</strong> - Tibor Bödecs</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/tree/main/Documentation"><strong>SPM Repo Documentation</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://swift.org/package-manager/"><strong>Swift.org SPM Documentation</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages"><strong>Apple SPM Documentation</strong></a></li></ul><h2>Xcode Not Required</h2><p>One important thing to note is that you do not need to open Xcode to compile the Swift package. Obviously there are benefits to using Xcode for editing your Swift code. However you can use any text editor to create and edit your files. (Or use the terminal to create your file via</p><p><code>touch FileName.swift</code>. To compile the package you can simply type in the terminal: <code>swift build</code>.</p><p>As a matter of factor you don't even need a Mac. <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/swift-package-continuous-integration-guide/">In the next article, we'll talk about some ways to automate and verify your build with CI and git hook integration.</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/4-tips-apple-store-review-guidelines</guid><title>4-tips-apple-store-review-guidelines</title><description>Building an iOS app is a complex process. One of the last things you have to do is pass an App Store Review. Here are 4 tips for success.</description><link>https://brightdigit.com/articles/4-tips-apple-store-review-guidelines</link><pubDate>Tue, 4 May 2021 10:12:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building and publishing an app is a complex process. One of the last things you have to do before your app can go live on the App Store is passing Apple's App Store Review.</p><p><strong>The challenge is that Apple isn't always completely clear</strong> about the Review process. You would think Apple would want greater clarity on its Store, but given the complexity of all the different kinds of apps in the Store, it's impossible to not have exceptions or at least grey areas where it's not clear which rules might apply.</p><p><strong>Here are four tips to help you avoid some of the trickiest things that might come up in a Store Review.</strong></p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-01-at-10.22.45-AM-1024x277.png" alt="An Example of In-App Purchases"/>{.wp-image-2306} :::</p><h2>Set Up Your In-App Purchases</h2><p>It shouldn't come as any surprise, but Apple is quite particular about the use of In-App Purchases. They are, after all, how Apple makes money.</p><p>For your first-ever Store Review, your In-App Purchases must be complete and integrated into the app. <strong>Not having them complete, up-to-date, and clear about what the customer is paying for is essentially going to guarantee your app will be rejected or declared incomplete.</strong></p><p>What usually trips up a lot of developers is that the Store Review is not just a quality check on your app's functionality and usability -- it is also an assessment of the validity of your business model. If the reviewer can't easily discern what your model is, they're not going to pass you.</p><p>You should include an explanation of your In-App Purchases in your App Review Notes, including any supporting documentation that might be needed. This includes things like purchase icons, screenshots, and what will be visible in an app preview.</p><h3>If You Want To Use Auto-Renewing Subscriptions...</h3><p>There isn't a lot that needs to be said about this, only that if your app offers auto-renewing, in-app subscriptions, Apple requires you to provide ongoing value to subscribed users.</p><p>This means that you need to be regularly delivering new content, updates, features, or services to these users. Apple is pretty flexible about what qualifies as <em>ongoing value</em>, only that it must be there, and users should be able to access it without needing to perform additional tasks (i.e. they don't need to download anything, rate the app, etc.).</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/copyright.png"/>{.wp-image-2307} :::</p><h2>Be Careful About Your Use of Copyrighted Content</h2><p><strong>Legal copyright issues are often one of the things that catch out developers when it comes to content on their apps.</strong> This isn't strictly a problem with Apple: copyright law has a lot of grey areas, and often doesn't become clearer until someone gets sued.</p><p>Apple's official line is:</p><blockquote><p>*Don't use protected third-party material such as trademarks, copyrighted works, or patented ideas in your app without permission, and don't include misleading, false, or copycat representations, names, or metadata in your app bundle or developer name.* <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#intellectual-property">Apple App Store Review Guidelines - 5.2.1 Intellectual &gt; Property</a></p></blockquote><p>What commonly happens is an app will get rejected or delayed because it uses content -- usually videos, pictures, music, or literature -- that is not owned by the developer.</p><p>Be sure to include, when submitting your app for review, that <strong>you have documentation that shows that you are either the owner of the content in your app, or that shows you have permission from the copyright owner to use their content in your app</strong>. That last little bit might be a little hazy, as there are a wide array of different copyright permissions you can be authorized for (and these might change depending on your legal jurisdiction), so be sure to read the fine print before you submit your app for review. That said, this is not legal advice, and you should consult with a lawyer if you have questions or aren't sure about something.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/apple_ios-update_privacy-controls_04262021.jpg" alt="New Privacy Controls in iOS 14.5"/>{.wp-image-2308} :::</p><h2>Make Sure You're Using the "Right" 3rd-Party Plugins &amp; Libraries</h2><p>Along with copyrighted material, Apple is also strict about what libraries and plugins you can use in your app. You are responsible that everything in your app, including third-party services, complies with Apple's guidelines.</p><p><strong>This is especially true if you're using analytics libraries.</strong> The principal reason is their concern for data security and privacy. Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">recently updated its guidance regarding data privacy</a>. I recommend you give it a read, but some notable highlights include:</p><ul><li>If your app is collecting any data from your users, you need to provide a detailed explanation of what data is being collected and how, and all the ways you're going to use that data.</li><li>If you're collecting data, you must have the consent of the user, and there will be no tolerance for coercing consent for unnecessary data collection.</li><li>You may only request data collection if you can show that the data is relevant to the core functionality of your app</li></ul><p>Something that gets overlooked is that in the case of very popular third-party services there may be multiple libraries of them, including many that might use "hacks" to get the data you want.</p><p>In many cases, only the use of the service provider-approved version will pass the Store Review. For example, you might want to use embedded YouTube videos, for which you might be able to find several libraries that facilitate them, and while you might find one that perfectly fits your needs, there is only one approved YouTube library (that is also assured to comply) that will be allowed to pass the Review.</p><h2>Don't Try to Cheat Apple -- There's Probably A Better Way</h2><p>You might remember the controversy surrounding the Hey app, that made industry headlines last year trying to get around the normal 30% cut that Apple takes from In-App purchases. Without going through the entire story Hey tried to avoid paying Apple by declaring itself a reader app like Netflix or Spotify (it's an email service), and Apple (eventually) said no. After that, Basecamp, Hey's developer, added a feature allowing for free randomized temporary email addresses that you could get through the app, which appears to have satisfied Apple.</p><p>Regardless of the way you stand in the debate, the takeaway is it's a losing fight to try to cheat Apple (unless you're just looking for publicity or have a squad of lawyers backing you up). But, <strong>if you're confronted with a dispute with them, there may well be a creative solution to your problem.</strong></p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":393606,"title":"App Store Review Guidelines with Paweł Madej","episode<em>type":"full","number":68,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"November 7, 2020","duration":3022,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":50,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"50:22","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/1decc81f/2b20bb50.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/1decc81f","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/episode/393606/thumb</em>1604511329-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this episode, Leo chats with Paweł Madej, pharmacist turned iOS developer on his learning experience and what pitfalls devs should know about App Store reviews.

There's everything from APT to Maven to chocolatey. For those who work in the Apple space we are probably more familiar with Cocoapods and Homebrew. However since the introduction of Swift, the Apple team has given us a new package manager: <strong>Swift Package Manager</strong>.</p><p>In this article, I'll cover:</p><ul><li>what iOS and other Swift developers can use</li><li>the advantages of SPM (Swift Package Manager) from its predecessors</li></ul><p>First, let's get into <strong>why you'd want to use any package manager in the first place</strong>.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/030-puzzle-17054.png"/><p>{.wp-image-1146}</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/029-delivery-17051.png"/><p>{.wp-image-1145}</p><h2>Modularity and Reuse - Benefits of Package Management</h2><p><strong>One key component of package management is the ability to share code or an executable</strong> - whether that's publicly or just within your internal dev team.</p><p>Part of doing that is breaking your code into separate pieces. This is where package managers encourage <strong>modularization</strong>. In other words components can be separated out, tested properly, and used by others.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":102357,"title":"Modularizing in Xcode with Abbey

Usually you can specify a <em><a href="https://semver.org">semver</a></em> compatible version number related to a version tag or even a branch name. Let's get into the different package managers for developers in the Apple ecosystem.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/colored-14344.png"/><p>{.wp-image-1148}</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/pasted-image-small-14348.png"/><p>{.wp-image-1149}</p><h2>What Came Before... and is Still Around</h2><p>Swift Package Manager is fairly a new addition for Swift developers let alone iOS and macOS developers. Let's talk about what what has come before for developers.</p><p><strong>Carthage</strong> has been around since the advent of Swift. Carthage really specializes in building the binary frameworks and sharing those within your project. Before Carthage, there was <strong>CocoaPods</strong> which has been around since the early days of Objective-C.</p><p>One drawback is that Cocoapods is built in Ruby and is therefore dependent on having the correct versions of Ruby installed while Carthage is built in Swift. Another drawback for Cocoapods is that <strong>it requires modification of your Xcode projects and workspaces</strong>. Carthage gets around this by having the user <strong>add the built frameworks the manually the first time they integrate it.</strong> If you are interested in some of the choices where Carthage differs from Cocoapods, check out <a href="https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#differences-between-carthage-and-cocoapods">this piece the Carthage README.</a></p><p>Lastly, if neither works for your project, there's <strong><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">git submodules</a></strong>. Git Submodules are the most difficult to deal with, but perhaps the most versatile. They simply require an available git repo to link to a subdirectory. If you plan editing your dependency, git submodules may be required.</p><p><strong>If you are going to use a package manager, choose one at best and stick with it.</strong> However your best bet is migrating to Swift Package Manager.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Xcode_Icon-small-15043.png"/>{.wp-image-1151} :::</p><h2>Why Swift Package Manager?</h2><p>Swift Package Manager brings plenty of benefits along with it. Along with it's versatile handing of versioning, SPM (Swift Package Manager) is natively supported in Swift. While tools like CocoaPods require Ruby and other Gem dependencies, there's no need with SPM. SPM simply requires either Swift or Xcode be installed on your macOS or Linux machine.</p><p><strong>SPM is also open-source while also being supported by Apple. This means you get the benefits of seeing how something works and being open to the community as well as in Apple's best interest to support it.</strong></p><p>Really it comes down to whether your current line of dependencies support SPM. At this point, the list of Cocoapods and Carthage packages which also support SPM continues to grow as SPM expands its support for features like binary packages (i.e. XCFrameworks).</p><p>::: {.wp-block-embed_<em>wrapper} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZhvfG</em>vd5Y :::</p><p>Not only does SPM provide benefits in your Xcode projects but also in the way you modularize and share your code.</p><h2>Why Publish with Swift Package Manager?</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons to break apart your application or even publish your library or executable via Swift Package Manager. For one thing, i<strong>t becomes easier to build your application completely in Swift - from server to device.</strong></p><h3>Full Stack Swift</h3><p>For instance, you can build your supporting server application in Swift whether that's Vapor, Lambda, Smoke, or Hummingbird. By doing that, <strong>you can share code between client (iOS application) and server.</strong> Specifically Codable models can be shared on both iOS and the server. Even if you have an existing server, you can build a mock server in Swift for testing.</p><pre><code><span class="comment">// an example of sharing server-side and client-side code via SPM

<span class="keyword">public struct</span> WorkoutData {
  <span class="keyword">public let</span> heartRate: <span class="type">Double</span>?

</code></pre><p>If you are going the route of building both ends of your application in Swift, SPM is the only way to go. In fact for parts of your code that can be abstracted away from the device, SPM has advantages over Xcode when it comes to testing.</p><h3>Testability</h3><p>The ease of testing through SPM is really nice as well. Especially when it's difficult and slow to do in simulator. For instance before Xcode 12.5 supported watchOS testing, it was nearly impossible to run unit tests for watchOS.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://youtu.be/fzLkHAku1mc?t=1723 :::</p><p>Interested in learning more about developing a Full Stack Swift application?<br>Check out my talk from iOSDevCampDC2020</p><p>However by having most of your Apple Watch application code in a Swift package, I can easily test code which doesn't require watchOS specifically. <strong>This circumvents the issue but also makes it easier without needing an actual device or via simulator.</strong></p><p>In spots where code is only applicable and available on the watch, such as SwiftUI or HealthKit code I can use a combination of preprocessor directives to mark availability:</p><pre><code><span class="comment">// using canImport and os to disable applicable code</span>

<span class="preprocessing">#if canImport(HealthKit)</span>
  <span class="keyword">import</span> HealthKit

  <span class="keyword">extension</span> <span class="type">HKHealthStore</span>: <span class="type">HealthInterface</span> {
    <span class="keyword">public func</span> workout(withConfiguration configuration: <span class="type">WorkoutConfiguration</span>) <span class="keyword">throws</span> -&gt; <span class="type">Workout</span> {
      <span class="keyword">let</span> hkConfig = <span class="type">HKWorkoutConfiguration</span>()
      hkConfig.<span class="property">activityType</span> = configuration.<span class="property">activityType</span>.<span class="property">healthKitType</span>
      <span class="preprocessing">#if os(watchOS)</span>
        <span class="keyword">return try</span> <span class="type">HealthKitLiveWorkout</span>(fromHealthStore: <span class="keyword">self</span>, withConfiguration: hkConfig)
      <span class="preprocessing">#else</span>
        <span class="keyword">return try</span> <span class="type">HealthKitWorkout</span>(fromHealthStore: <span class="keyword">self</span>, withConfiguration: hkConfig)
      <span class="preprocessing">#endif</span>
    }
  }
<span class="preprocessing">#endif</span>
</code></pre><p>Not only that but as I develop a server-side application I may not want to run the watchOS application every time to test capabilities on the server. This is where refactoring into a Swift package is also useful. By having a library which contains most of my watchOS code, I can simulate the heart rate in the Apple Watch application by creating a simple command line application.</p><h3>Command Line Tools</h3><p><strong>SPM allows me to duplicate the functionality of Heartwitch, my watchOS app, into a command line tool</strong> which replicates the heart rate sensor feature. This makes it easier to test the server application without having to run the Heartwitch app on my Apple Watch or via simulator.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/hwmonitor-1024x495.gif" alt="Faking a Watch App with a Command Line Tool"/><p>{.wp-image-1165}</p><p>One of my favorite tools out there is <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser">the Swift Argument Parser by the Swift team</a>.</p><p><strong>Swift Argument Parser builds on the great ideas from Swift UI (i.e. Property Wrappers) and Codable and brings that to the command line.</strong> You can do things like subcommands, helpful feedback, options, and flags. In my case, I use it to enable faster server-side development. Specifically I built a command line tool to replicate the heart rate monitoring feature of the Apple Watch app and feed my server simulated heart rates.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":251315,"title":"Haikus of Code with Erica Sadun - Part 1","episode<em>type":"full","number":51,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"June 8, 2020","duration":1762,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":29,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"29:22","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/4d6360c9/39268d46.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/4d6360c9","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/episode/251315/thumb</em>1591378273-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this episode, Leo talks with Erica Sadun about the Swift Argument Parser, Graphics Support in Xcode, being a Mac user in general, and more.

It involves the process of refactoring, rewriting, and replacing some or all of the app's code.</p><p>This can introduce risk and uncertainty. However, <strong>it's an opportunity to ensure your users are getting the best experience</strong> possible from your app. Over a long enough time, every app needs to be upgraded, whether to support the newer versions of iOS or take advantage of the latest features., Unfortunately, because the process is so often difficult, headache-inducing, and complicated, it is rarely looked forward to, and often avoided.</p><p>It is true that app upgrades aren't easy. But they don't need to be painful if you plan ahead and make some key decisions of how to approach the process.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":399587,"title":"Maintaining u0026

If the old code was well-written, appropriately documented, and has a minimal number of pre-existing bugs, there's a risk rewriting it will introduce new bugs. Therefore refactoring would be a better option - at least for now.</p><h2>Start with Unit Tests</h2><p>So you're committed to upgrading your old iOS app, where do you start?</p><p>To make it as easy as possible to maintain and avoid a massive headache for yourself later on, <strong>you're going to want to start by writing the unit tests you need.</strong></p><p>This is the core principle of <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/01/06/avoid-ios-app-failure-with-tdd/">Test-Driven Development (TDD)</a>. The idea is, by writing tests first, you create a strong foundation for the code that you can build on as you progress. Here are the basics for unit testing, in case you are unsure:</p><ul><li>You <strong>write a unit test</strong> describing one piece of functionality of the app</li><li>You will <strong>run the test</strong>, which should fail because the refactored code to make it work hasn't been written yet.</li><li>You <strong>write and refactor</strong> the least amount of code possible to pass the unit test</li><li><strong>Repeat</strong> until you have enough test coverage for what you need</li></ul><p>The biggest benefits of this approach:</p><ul><li>Practically guarantees **you're always working in the right direction** when refactoring code</li><li><strong>Reduces the possibility of there being any bugs</strong> or errors in the refactored app</li><li>Over the long term, it can drastically **reduce the amount of time and effort** needed as the project progresses</li><li>This approach also encourages developers to have **healthy, effective habits of building good software** architecture.</li></ul><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":59420,"title":"Test-Driven Development with Joshua Greene and Michael Katz ","episode<em>type":"full","number":15,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"June 16, 2019","duration":2824,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":47,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"47:04","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/eddb8632/a18c0801.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/eddb8632","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/122/thumb</em>1533929410-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this episode we talk with Joshua Greene and Michael Katz, authors of iOS Test Driven Development by Tutorials.

For example, when refactoring an app originally built using UIKit to use SwiftUI, you can use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable">UIViewRepresentable</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewcontrollerrepresentable">UIViewControllerRepresentable</a> or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uihostingcontroller">UIHostingController</a> to interface between new and old code.</p><ul><li>For using a <strong>SwiftUI View inside a UIKit View</strong> use:<ul><li><strong><em>UIHostingController</em></strong></li><li>For using a <strong>UIView from UIKit inside a SwiftUI View</strong> use:</li><li><strong><em>UIViewRepresentable</em></strong></li><li>For using a <strong>UIViewController from UIKit inside a SwiftUI View</strong> use</li><li><strong><em>UIViewControllerRepresentable</em></strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>If you are upgrading an older app written in Objective-C -- that you are upgrading to use code written in Swift -- you can use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/imported_c_and_objective-c_apis/importing_objective-c_into_swift">Swift bridging</a>, which will keep the Objective-C code working as you implement the new code structure necessary for Swift. If you still need to write Objective-C to bridge that gap, <strong>I'd recommend <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/objective-c-and-swift-being-friendly/">our article on writing Swift-friendly Objective-C code.</a></strong> If your app falls into this category, this is something you probably should be considering, as Apple has made it pretty clear that it everything new <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/02/04/swiftui-everything-is-possible-if-you-think-like-apple/">in its software ecosystem will be exclusively Swift.</a></p><p>The second strategy uses failure as an active tool to both discover and implement new code. Rather than trying to sustain the old code while creating the new, you start by aiming to have the new code immediately replace the old as the project progresses</p><p>This should result in code regularly failing to compile. However, by actively failing, you are able to rapidly discover what is and is not working, and focus on writing code for what is broken.</p><h3>Which strategy should you use?</h3><p>Now, you might ask yourself, which technique should I use? The simple answer, as is often the case with software, is <em>it depends</em>. Both are perfectly valid, at depending on the nature of the code, there may come a point where you end up using both.</p><p><strong>The side-by-side bridging strategy has the advantage of being able to seamlessly integrate new code</strong> with the old over time on a live app. The reason being that your users might not even notice a difference in functionality. The result is a stable, consistent process that allows you to control when big changes are needed</p><p>On the other hand, <strong>the break and replace strategy will quickly reveal the most important parts</strong> of the code you need to refactor, getting right down to the root of any dirty code or <em>code smells</em> that might exist.</p><p>However, if your app has a lot of complicated code, you might find a break and replace strategy is even more time-consuming. It will potentially force you to pull out very large sections of code that will need to be entirely rebuilt before they can be deployed. That said, if your developers retain a history of the code, this could be done relatively quickly. Having been working with the code for a long time, they can then be very focused on what they are looking for and what will need to be refactored.</p><h2>More Tips For Upgrading Your App</h2><p><strong>Have rules, be consistent with them</strong></p><p>Having rules when coding is important -- this goes doubly when refactoring. If you're going to have a lot of people working on your code, make sure everyone has a shared understanding of how things are to be done, recorded, and tracked throughout the project.</p><p>As an example, I like to ask other developers whether they use tabs vs. spaces in their code. Every developer of any significant experience will prefer one or the other. It's a small, but important rule that you want to make sure all the developers working on your app are aligned with, as it can affect <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/03/31/ios-software-architecture/">the code quality of the app's software architecture overall</a>. Other things you'll want to establish rules for include how new code is integrated into the app, for which <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/03/02/ios-continuous-integration-avoid-merge-hell/">I recommend using continuous integration techniques.</a></p><p><strong>Have a Clear, Consistent System for Bug Tracking</strong></p><p>Like any good software project, but particularly important when upgrading an iOS app is having a clear process for bug tracking. I've previously <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/12/08/swift-error-handling/">written about tracking bugs and error handling in Swift here</a>. There are many tools and services available, including a few online services that are great for tracking bugs and log statements, such as:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.bugsnag.com">Bugsnag</a></li><li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li><li><a href="https://instabug.com">Instabug</a></li></ul><p>As a small side note: there is a good case to be made, for apps running on iOS 14 and later, to make use of OSLog. <a href="https://www.avanderlee.com/workflow/oslog-unified-logging/">If you're not familiar, it's a handy library for logging messages to the console.</a> It's particularly useful for being able to filter out categories of app logs within the console app when compiling code as well.</p><p><strong>Avoid 3rd Party Dependencies</strong></p><p>While bug trackers can be a valid 3rd party dependency, there are many which you should avoid if you can. Every time you use a new dependency in your app, you're exposing it to the risk of bugs or outright failure if the 3rd party ever decides to shut down or has not been properly upgraded and maintained themselves.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXePggcWpuE :::</p><p>If you are going to use a 3rd-party library or tool, make sure you spend time weighing the costs to your app should it fail against the benefits it gives.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":402705,"title":"Maintaining u0026 Migrating with Antoine van der Lee - Part 2","episode<em>type":"full","number":70,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"November 19, 2020","duration":1804,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":30,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"30:04","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/dc84aaa9/4ac2257f.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/dc84aaa9","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/episode/402705/thumb</em>1605624259-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this second part of our interview with Antoine van der Lee, we talk about how to upgrade older apps piecemeal, supporting older OSes, as well as bug tracking and logging.

Like restoring anything though, it's important to be patient, as you're likely to encounter obstacles that are difficult to anticipate.</p><p>Begin by deciding how much value the app offers and how much time you have to undertake the upgrade. If you're sure this is right for your app, begin with a test-driven development strategy that ensures your progress will be consistent, and easy to maintain after the upgrade is complete.</p><p>Decide whether slow bridging refactor or a break and replace strategy is most appropriate for you. You can figure this out by considering:</p><ul><li>what is needed from the app</li><li>how much time you have available</li><li>how complicated your app is</li><li>and most importantly, how much knowledge your development team has of the history of the code</li></ul><p>Finally, make sure to always have clear, consistent rules for coding and refactoring, especially for complex apps and where you have many people working on the app. Be sure to have a reliable way to log and track bugs, and, within reason, avoid relying on 3rd party dependencies.</p><h2>Tell me more about your iOS app</h2><p>Do you have an iOS app that you are upgrading, or planning to upgrade? Do you want to learn more about the process? I'd like to know and answer any questions you might have. <strong>I offer some free consulting time each month for companies that are serious about moving their iOS app projects forward and are looking for help or guidance.</strong> To book a free consultation call with me, <a href="https://doodle.com/mm/leodion/book-a-time">go here and book an appointment</a>. I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about your app!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/working-remotely-ios-development</guid><title>working-remotely-ios-development</title><description>Working remotely on iOS development can be very successful.

Working remotely will be more common, even after the global pandemic has passed.</p><p>Remote work in software development isn't anything new. Just ask those with experience in <strong><a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/content/distributed-software-development"><em>distributed software development</em></a>.</strong></p><p>There are some important lessons we've learned over the years on how to do work remotely well. There are benefits that help both employees and employers. I'll go through the most important best practices you're going to want to put in place. This will ensure remote work supports your capacity to build great iOS apps without slowing everything down.</p><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/dan-gold-kARZuSYMfrA-unsplash-1024x576.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-2270}</p><h2>The Benefits of Remote Working</h2><p>As an independent developer, I have a bias for remote work -- I've been working remotely for almost 10 years. I've noticed major benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Dealing with Home Life</strong> - It makes it easier to adapt to changing circumstances in your work and home life. If a project you're working on needs your attention unexpectedly, or one of your children is home from school sick, it's much easier to adapt with everything you need within easy reach.</li></ul><pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre><ul><li><strong>Saving Time and Money</strong> - Working from home saves an enormous amount of time and money that you may not be aware of until you try it. It is estimated that, before COVID-19, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/07/nine-days-road-average-commute-time-reached-new-record-last-year/">average American was spending 225 hours a year</a> -- more than nine calendar days -- commuting. As well, the cost of car maintenance and/or public transit adds up to thousands of dollars each year. And that's to say nothing of what other things you could be doing for your work or life with that time.</li></ul><pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre><ul><li><strong>Reducing Overhead</strong> - It reduces overhead and productivity loss from commuting and needing an office to accommodate all your staff all the time. There is data that shows that, if management has a positive, trusting relationship with their staff, <a href="https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html">remote work can give employees a significant productivity boost</a>.</li></ul><pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre><ul><li><strong>Improved Flexibility</strong> - Remote working can also make the business more competitive. First, the flexibility of remote work makes it easier for employees to deliver their best work and for employers to retain them. As well, remote working usually forces a shift toward focusing on whether goals are being met, and away from performance being judged by mere presence in the office.</li></ul><p>Some of these benefits are hampered by the fact that remote working needed to be implemented quickly. This is further compounded by complications like healthcare, loss of business, and having kids remote learning from home. However, we can reasonably expect it to get easier.</p><h2>Working Remotely Best Practices for iOS Development</h2><h3>Get Buy-in</h3><p>This should be obvious to most people, but with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/73-business-transformations-fail-biggest-failure-factor-lowgren/">the regular failure of <em>workplace transformations</em></a>, the realization that <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-truth-about-open-offices">the much-vaunted open-plan office did the opposite of what it was sold to do</a>, and the additional analysis that shows <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/will-coronavirus-end-the-open-office-floor-plan">such offices are excellent vectors of disease</a>, it bears repeating. If you're a manager, keen to implement remote work for your team, you need to make the change collaborative. If you want your developers to be effective with a remote work policy, <strong>have them be a part in creating it. </strong></p><p>The pandemic imposed this way of work on millions in a way that they never got to have a say in, let alone prepare for.</p><h3>iOS App Provisioning</h3><p><strong>App Provisioning is probably the single most important Apple-specific consideration when it comes to remote work.</strong> Apple has a chain of authority between itself and your app. This chain is designed to make sure your app is trustworthy and stable before being downloadable from the App Store. Apple doesn't make it especially easy to understand how it works.</p><h4>A Brief (as possible) explanation of iOS App Provisioning</h4><p>First, there is the Apple Certificate Authority. It serves as the gatekeeper to the App Store.</p><p>When you start building an iOS app, you create a Signing Certificate. This identifies you as a developer recognized by Apple. Creating a Signing Certificate generates a key on your computer (and only your computer) that connects you to the Apple Certificate Authority.</p><p>With that done, the iOS app you're creating is assigned an App ID, linking your app to your Signing Certificate.</p><p><strong>Next, you must create Provisioning Profiles.</strong> These profiles declare connections between a specific build of your app and the App ID. Each profile specifies what that build is for (i.e. internal development, adhoc distribution, release to the App Store). It may also contain a list of devices where the app can be tested and distributed.</p><p>Now, why does this all matter if you want to work remotely? Because to make this work, you're going to need to determine, for every member of your development team, who has what access to a specific provision profile, and on which machines (both in the work office and the remote office). You'll also need to decide who handles the computer with the Signing Certificate key.</p><p>It's not especially difficult to manage once it's done, but expect it to be a time-consuming task to set up.</p><p>I highly recommend taking a look at the Fastlane suite and their <a href="https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/">Match command</a> to help streamline this. Also here's a great list of tech articles to help with this:</p><ul><li><a href="https://martiancraft.com/blog/2017/05/demystifying-ios-provisioning-part1/">DEMYSTIFYING IOS PROVISIONING By Cory Bohon</a></li><li><a href="https://martiancraft.com/blog/2017/05/demystifying-ios-provisioning-part1/">What is a provisioning profile &amp; code signing in iOS? by Abhimuralidharan</a></li></ul><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/chris-montgomery-smgTvepind4-unsplash-1024x768.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-2271}</p><h3>Communication</h3><p>Successful remote work is almost entirely about communication. Critically, the style of communication needed for effective remote work is different from those that are successful when everyone is together. You need a different set of rules and tools for remote work communication:</p><h4>Choose your tools</h4><p>For many teams, there is likely already an answer to the question of what tool they want to use for communication because they're already using one. <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-us/">Slack</a> is far and away the most popular. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">MS Teams</a> and <a href="https://www.chanty.com">Chanty</a> are also proven and effective platforms. There are many different tools and platforms available depending on how many people are involved and the details of what they need.</p><h4>Choose your communication rules</h4><p>In an office, people pick up on what are usually unwritten rules of communication through context and observation. This is obviously much more difficult when your colleagues only appear as names on a screen.</p><p>To keep things running smoothly, make rules written and explicit.</p><ul><li>How often should you reasonably wait for a response during work hours?</li><li>And work hours in which timezone?</li><li>With many channels, what information do you put in which channel?</li><li>If there are important announcements, how are those delivered?</li></ul><p>These are just some questions for which the answers should rules or guidelines.</p><p>With asynchronous communication, you need to be open to learning new communication habits. You will need a different attitude than you do at the office. People will not always message you back right away. If you need to talk to someone about something important, schedule a meeting.</p><p>For more details on how to communicate remotely, <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/2445da70">we did a podcast episode on this very topic.</a> We talked with Jacob Gorban who has been leading remote work for over 10 years at his company <a href="https://www.apparentsoft.com"><strong>Apparent Software.</strong></a> Not only do we talk about communication, but also keeping teams productive, managing iOS development and more.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app

How you handle this up to you: you might schedule meetings between senior developers and juniors, or even (when conditions allow) having them meet at the office.</p><h3>Working Remotely Doesn't Work For Everyone</h3><p>There are some conditions where remote work probably isn't an optimal policy. Much like getting buy-in, involving everyone and discussing how remote work might work should reveal if it's a good idea. That said, there are cases where it can often be unhelpful:</p><ul><li>Unstable or rapidly changing workflow<br> Remote work usually succeeds when the workflow is stable and consistent (even if there are rapid changes within the project itself). If the workflow is constantly shifting, remote work can work, but you're probably going to discover you will need to bring everyone together often to ensure they're all on the same page.</li></ul><pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre><ul><li>Inexperienced teams or very old teams<br> Remote work tends to work best with teams that already know and understand each other well. If team members are working with each other for the first time, there is no reason they shouldn't be able to work remotely, but they should have opportunities to work together to build better rapport.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, teams that have been together for a long time, and have up until this point only worked together in the same space, might find remote work challenging if it goes against the grain of how they've always worked together before.</p><p>None of this should be considered a universal rule, only that it shouldn't be surprising if teams like these find remote work to be difficult.</p><h2>Getting started with working remotely</h2><p>To make remote work iOS development a successful practice, you do need to put in the work up front. A lot of it is communication-related, with some technical. Done effectively, it can be a powerful tool for your organization. It can help you develop better apps faster, and with less overhead and friction than when working together in an office.</p><h2>Was this useful to you?

As developers, we want as much information about how and why something failed to either make the best possible change to the code or to help the user respond. However, <strong>what is most helpful for the developer is not always so helpful for the user, which is critical to understand if you want a successful app.</strong></p><p>This article is designed to help both developers and team managers:</p><ul><li>create a plan for dealing with errors; and</li><li>offer examples of how to effectively handle the most common errors you'll encounter.</li></ul><h2>Successful Swift Error Handling Always Starts With A Plan</h2><p>If you're on a team that manages an app's codebase, or are the manager of that team, you need to have an effective plan for dealing with errors. Not having a plan, or having a plan not clearly understood by everyone, is going to needlessly create more work for everyone, and you'll find it difficult to deliver a consistent and satisfying experience to your users.</p><p>An effective error handling plan for a Swift-built app should include:</p><ul><li><strong>Recording and Tracking Errors</strong><br> You need a tool that records and tracks errors. Crashlytics and Bugsnag are two popular ones. Beyond that, you should have some kind of internal process on the team level for acknowledging, assigning, and reviewing errors, so that they don't use up more team resources than necessary to address.<br>- <strong>Error Testing</strong><br> If you expect an error and crash, you should test for those in your unit tests. While XCTest provides ways to test for errors, crashes take a little bit of work.</li></ul><p>I'd recommend taking a look at the <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/03d8db53">links on our Error Handling episode</a> with Jeff Kelley or his presentation from 360iDev:</p><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://vimeo.com/366587634 :::</p><p><br>A successful testing approach for Swift should then include this functionality, allowing you to be able to proactively fix and, more importantly, anticipate and accommodate expected errors.<br> - <strong>Communicating With Users</strong><br> This last part is essential to delivering a quality user experience. So many apps that experience errors do an inadequate job of communicating to the user how and why an error occurs, or what the user might be able to do to avoid the error in the future. A successful error handling plan should include an approach to using UI tools to inform and help your user when they experience an error using your app.</p><p>That last part of the plan, clearly communicating with and engaging your user in the event of an error, can be very challenging. To help, I've got examples of three of the most common types of errors you'll likely encounter, and how to engage your users when they happen.</p><h3>Networking Errors -- Don't Overwhelm Your User</h3><p>Network errors are likely to be the most common type of error when developing an app with Swift. Most iOS apps, or apps of any kind for that matter, have networking as a core part of their functionality.</p><p>As a preventative measure, you want some sort of indication built into your app that there is network connectivity, especially if something is in progress. For example, <strong>if the app is transferring data, you should make that clear to your user and warn them not to disconnect.</strong></p><p>Networking errors are a good example of the kind of error where you'll likely need your user to take action. If your app tries to connect and the network is unavailable, use a dialogue screen explaining to your user that the app has failed due to inadequate connectivity. For a superior user experience, give the user the option to try and connect again, if possible.</p><p>But, as anyone that has ever coded a <em>try again</em> button knows, this can be difficult to do depending if your network architecture isn't separate from your app UI (common in most modern apps). The error and information explaining why it happened need to be raised to a point where the user can respond, which can be tricky to determine.</p><p>What is critical is considering how much detail about the network error you want to relay to the user. While the error number and data are useful for a developer, that much information is going to be overwhelming to a non-technical user. As a rule, if the information is not relevant to the user experience, it should be hidden from the user.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-03-at-7.27.00-AM-3.png" alt="<a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/alerts/">From Apple's Human Interface Guidelines on Alerts</a>"/>{.wp-image-2252} :::</p><h3>Permissions -- An Informed User is a Happy User</h3><p>Building on communicating effectively with your user, sometimes you'll have errors that require your user to make decisions to get the app working again. Apple's system for accessing Protected Resources is a source of great examples of this scenario.</p><p>Even if you're not intimately familiar with this aspect of the Apple ecosystem, it's easy enough to understand: <strong>our phones and devices have a lot of sensitive information about us on them these days</strong>; Many apps use this data to help their users; This includes location information, your photos, and access to the camera itself, among other things. These are known as Protected Resources.</p><p>Because not all apps need access to them, by default Apple restricts access to Protected Resources. If an app needs a Protected Resource to carry out a function and doesn't have access, this will create an error. To gain access, an app must make a case request, with an explanation of why it needs permission to use certain data or hardware functions. The user then decides whether to give permission to the app or not.</p><p>There are two key considerations when dealing with permissions. The first is making it clear to the user why the app needs access to a given Protected Resource. Apple itself is explicit about this:</p><p><strong><em>"Accurately and concisely explaining to the user why your app needs access to sensitive data, typically in one complete sentence, lets the user make an informed decision and improves the chances that they'll grant access."</em></strong></p><p>Having an easy-to-understand explanation then is not only needed, it makes for a better user experience and ultimately, a more successful app.</p><p>The second consideration is deciding how to handle the user denying permission. Again, clear communication to the user about the limitations of the app's functionality if denied access is helpful. You also must decide, on a code level, how to deal with the persistent error of denied permission.</p><p>Ideally, you want the user to still be able to use the app, even if certain data or functions are not available. At the same time, it's important to continue to make it clear that if a user wants to do something that needs a Protected Resource, they have to go into their settings and grant permission.</p><p>A stumbling block to be aware of is in some cases there isn't (yet) a way of telling the difference between a lack of access and a lack of input. A good example of this is heart rate monitoring: an app may experience an error because it can't collect data on a user's heart rate, but isn't able to report whether this is because of a lack of permission or because the heart rate sensor on the device isn't working.</p><p>If you're using health data, this is something to be aware of.</p><h3>Missing Files -- How to Fail Gracefully</h3><p>While many errors are recoverable with some help from the user, sometimes there are errors that can happen, and will be fatal. How should you handle these?</p><p>Ideally, you want to handle these errors as cleanly and gracefully as possible. Missing files are a common example of this -- when your app can't find or access a key resource it needs to function, like a storyboard file, an image, a database, or a key piece of code. The app needs to close and a bug report sent to the developer to review the error and make fixes.</p><p>Indicate to the user that something has gone seriously wrong and the app needs to shut down. Perhaps offer them a button to close the app and assure them that a bug report has been sent. You can also let them know if it's not just a glitch or the user has tampered with the app.<em> </em></p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":199013,"title":"Handling Errors Correctly with Jeff Kelley","episode<em>type":"full","number":40,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"March 15, 2020","duration":2991,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":50,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"49:51","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/03d8db53/88994a68.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/03d8db53","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/episode/199013/thumb</em>1582327124-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this episode, Leo talks with Jeff Kelley from Detroit Labs about handing, tracking and test errors and when they can happen.

The opinions or comments of executives and managers carry authority employees will feel compelled to respond to. And this is a problem if that organization's business is iOS development. Traditional methods of business management and current methods of iOS development don't work very well together. A good iOS team manager does things differently.</p><h2>iOS Development is unpredictable</h2><p>Building a complex iOS app is inherently unpredictable. You usually start a project with not much more than:</p><ul><li>a broad vision for the work,</li><li>a list of feature requirements,</li><li>and what problem the app needs to solve for the user.</li></ul><p><strong>No one can accurately predict what the app will be like when it's <em>done.</em></strong></p><p>There will be obstacles that arise that you only discover when you start publishing the app. Additionally, it's likely the client will change their requirements. Moreover, there could be a major change to a library halfway through the project. As a result, your team will need to rethink the app going forward.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cytonn-photography-n95VMLxqM2I-unsplash-1024x684.jpg"/>{.wp-image-2227} :::</p><h3>Tried and True iOS Team Management?</h3><p>This is fundamentally different from older, more established kinds of work. For instance, with accounting, we've been managing money for the entire history of human civilization. The work is governed by well-established rules, regulations, and best practices. For this reason, there is generally an established way to achieve a desired result if the accounting is done well.</p><p><strong>By comparison, iOS development is not even 15 years old.</strong> As a result, it has very few rules and best practices. In effect, there are multiple ways to a given result, each with pros and cons.</p><h2>What Does This Have To Do With Management?</h2><p>To manage this unpredictability, good iOS development teams are collaborative. Members need to be able to:</p><ul><li>flexibly share thoughts and ideas.</li><li>work together to solve unexpected problems.</li><li>not be constrained by a single way of approaching a specific problem.</li></ul><p>This goes beyond building the app. It is not unusual for an unforeseen change in the codebase, user behavior, or the client's business to destabilize an app. Most likely this will result in needing an update or additional maintenance.</p><p>Having a single person with an opinion (ie a manager or executive) who dictates how the app will be built becomes an obstacle to maintaining the best app possible. This is regardless of how much that manager or leader might know about software or how well-meaning they might be.</p><h3>Encouraging Your Team</h3><p>Managers aren't going to go away -- they almost always serve a key role in their organizations. The question is then: <strong>How can we reconcile management and iOS development?</strong> How might a manager work with a team, guiding and supporting their collaborative capacity? At the same time, how can a manager avoid tilting the team's decisions with their influence?</p><p>What I've found is that the best iOS managers share a few traits. These traits:</p><ul><li>help them build up and support their teams,</li><li>help them work without becoming controlling,</li><li>and balance the unpredictability of development work with the stability most businesses and organizations need.</li></ul><p><strong>What follows are three traits that the most amazing iOS managers I've worked with have shared.</strong></p><h2>They Are Great Listeners</h2><p>There's a tactic I've seen some managers use: when the team is working through something together, <strong>they make sure they are always the last one to speak</strong>. <strong>They don't want to influence the opinions of the team before they've had a chance to hear each other</strong>. As Peter Witham noted in my recent interview with him on my EmpowerApps.Show, it also gives the manager time to carefully listen and consider how the team thinks and feels before they weigh in.</p><p>How Peter Witham gets feedback as a manager from<br><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/4011273d">Episode 29 of Empower Apps</a></p><p>It really can't be underestimated how powerful it is to listen to the people you manage while resisting the urge to intervene, even if you feel strongly about the best way forward. Rather than an emphasis on control, assigning responsibility, and motivating the team -- valued by traditional management -- <strong>a good iOS manager sits back and listens.</strong></p><h3>Listening to your team</h3><p>Along with a bit of empathy, this can do wonders. Not only for your team's ability to organize its work and deliver it, but it also boosts the confidence of team members. <strong>As a result, this will encourage them to take on difficult challenges. Additionally, they are free to learn from those challenges, knowing they are supported by their boss.</strong></p><p>For instance, the team may be building an application that requires an Apple Watch component. How should that application synchronize with the iPhone app? Should the app be independent? Are watch complications worth the effort implementing? A manager may decide whatever the simplest solution that will save time and money is best. However, a more experienced developer with the Apple Watch knows the benefits and risks of different approaches:</p><ul><li>WatchConnectivity vs. Networking?</li><li>Independent vs. Dependent App?</li><li>Complications or App Only?</li></ul><p>That said, the manager still has an authoritative role. They are still responsible for deciding work priorities, as well as mediating relationships, specifically the relationship between app development and its value to the business. Part of that role includes setting boundaries on what is possible whether due to money or time. However, by taking a listening approach, rather than controlling and assigning, the team can easily address these limits as they do with any other limitation they have in building an app.</p><h2>They Welcome And Invite Challenges From The Team</h2><p>If a manager is committed to empathizing with their iOS development team, they must be open to having their mind changed. To that end, they must be able to entertain ideas or approaches that may not have initially occurred to them.</p><p>However, the best managers <strong>invite</strong> these kinds of challenges. An iOS manager is just as likely to miss things in the code, make bad calls, and screw up as anyone.</p><p>The goal is to make team members feel safe expressing themselves. Especially if they challenge the opinions, ideas, and decisions of their manager. And critically, when they feel the manager's opinions aren't serving the best interests of the team or the project.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/n-RFId0_7kep4-unsplash-1024x683.jpg"/>{.wp-image-2230 width="1024" height="683"} :::</p><h2>Understanding Your Options</h2><p>For instance, choosing a backend can be especially challenging. <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2019/07/30/best-backend-for-your-ios-app/">I have even written a whole blog post on the different choices.</a> In many cases, Firebase is the default choice. However, there are caveats that an opposing developer should present. While it could change the resulting backend, at the very least it makes the team aware of other challenges ahead.</p><p>There is more for a manager that is both capable of putting aside their ego (a challenging task in almost any work environment) and feels strongly about what should be done. <strong>Namely, they need to share their thoughts while actively asking the team to shoot them down. </strong></p><p><strong>The benefit of this is not only making the team feel comfortable with asserting itself but also it ensures someone will walk away from the interaction having learned something.</strong></p><h2>They actively support multiple solutions to problems</h2><p>Naturally following from being open to challenges and the questioning of ideas, supportive iOS managers help their team develop the capacity for multiple solutions. Most importantly, those solutions should be for persistent issues or obstacles they encounter during development.</p><p>One of the features of iOS development is how quickly everything changes. That is to say, what your iOS development team knows now could be less important in five years.</p><h3>Building For Now... and For The Future</h3><p>As an example, we have seen over the last five years the replacement of Objective-C with Swift as the preeminent language for native iOS development. For macOS developers, we are seeing a distinct shift toward Catalyst and away from AppKit. And most importantly, <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/02/04/swiftui-everything-is-possible-if-you-think-like-apple/">we see SwiftUI along with its patterns overtaking the paradigm Apple previously encouraged with UIKit</a> within the Apple ecosystem.</p><p>A good iOS manager needs to support team efforts to compensate for these rapid changes. Not only in building the app today but also to help them stay ahead of the curve.</p><p>What can you concretely do as a manager? Although it may come at the somewhat difficult sacrifice of short-term efficiency, you need to give your team the time and space to try new things and experiment.</p><p>This can be as simple as leaving time in the workweek. Give team members time to learn new tools, libraries, or APIs when they come out. Additionally, you could also encourage them to create side projects and showcase them to demonstrate the potential of new approaches. <strong>Over time, it helps the team adapt faster as new things come out and the nature of apps changes.</strong></p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":126648,"title":"Managing iOS Development with Peter

This was followed the next day by the release of the Watch's latest operating system, WatchOS 7.</p><p>This is a big deal for Apple app developers -- the new hardware and software offer new features that significantly raise the bar for what is possible with the Watch. Apple has given us the tools to create more sophisticated kinds of apps, both standalone for the Watch, as well as companions for iOS.</p><p><strong>By far the most important addition with WatchOS 7 is the newly enabled ability to build complications (i.e. watch face elements) using SwiftUI.</strong> This opens up all kinds of possibilities for how we can show information to users. There were also some great new service additions with the Family Setup and Fitness+. Finally, on the hardware side, the new blood oxygen sensor in the new Watch opens up opportunities for new apps, particularly in the health and fitness segment.</p><p>I'll be covering a general overview of these new features, then dive into what app developers can do to take advantage of this new release, and what I think they should consider offering to their customers.</p><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Apple_announces-watch-se_09152020-1024x881.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-2206}</p><h2>Watch Faces Are Now More Complicated... and that's a good thing.</h2><p>The most interesting part of the new Apple Watch Series 6 release is the power to create watch face complications using SwiftUI. Along with newly added complications, this expands what we can put on the watch face. It also makes the work of creating face customizations quicker and easier.</p><p><strong>SwiftUI complications remove the difficulties we've had building custom elements for Watch apps or Watch companions to iOS apps.</strong> This is especially noticeable with navigation bars. Particularly, SwiftUI can now be used to build dynamic navigation bars, the same as with any other Apple platform. Even better, you can now code these elements and reuse them, something that was painful about building apps on earlier versions of the Watch.</p><p><em>For more information on SwiftUI, <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/tag/swiftui/">check out our SwiftUI articles here.</a></em></p><p>The complications themselves are also more refined with SwiftUI. SwiftUI can make use of the same tools we use to code other Apple apps. This includes the ability to customize templates that already existed in SwiftUI, but weren't usable before now for the Watch. You can now also have more than one complication and watch face for an app. This has been a serious barrier before now to making more complex software. <strong>We also have more watch faces to choose from, with Apple pointing to the new Stripes, Chronograph, and Artist faces, giving more options for what we can render in a watch app.</strong></p><h2>New Blood Oxygen Sensor</h2><p>The sensor on the Series 6 Watches that measures blood oxygen levels is a great addition, particularly for developers that build apps for clients in the healthcare and fitness industry. The way it works is pretty straightforward -- the sensor measures the oxygen saturation levels using LEDs built into the back of the Watch.</p><p>What's also worth considering is what's not here (yet). The introduction of the blood oxygen sensor speaks to increasing sophistication in the Watch's hardware, which may mean even more impressive things are to come.</p><p>For instance, what if the Series 7 Watches could help detect blood <em>sugar</em> levels? Then we could build apps that could assist the millions of diabetics in the world -- with a watch -- and transform the way they manage their own health. Again, we're not there yet, but with this technology improving by leaps and bounds, it may be here soon.</p><h2>Even more from Apple Watch Series 6?</h2><p>The new Apple Watch Series 6 and has a couple of other things worth briefly noting:</p><h3>Family Setup</h3><p><strong>Family Setup is a system that allows multiple Watches to connect to a single iPhone.</strong> Apple sells this with the idea that kids can communicate with their parents through the Watch, while parents can keep track of where their kids are and send them reminders.</p><h3>Hardware Performance</h3><p>Overall, Series 6 is a nice improvement over its predecessors in terms of power and performance. <strong>It features a new CPU, the S6, making everything run faster.</strong> While the battery hasn't improved like we were hoping, it maintains 18 hours of battery life despite hardware upgrades and now includes fast-charging capability.</p><h2>So, what does this all mean?</h2><p>Several months back, I'd said that while the Apple Watch was good, it needed more improvements before it deserved great investment. With the exception of battery life, this new release demonstrates the maturity of the platform -- it's ready to stop being a curiosity worn only by early adopters and tech enthusiasts, and into something that most public consumers could benefit from having. The Apple Watch, in short, has arrived.</p><p><strong>The Apple Watch SE will also likely contribute to bringing more users into the fold with a smaller price tag while not skimping on performance.</strong> The SE models have the same size display, while only really compromising by not having an always-on display, the newest sensors found on the Series 6 (like the blood oxygen sensor), and limits on available colours and materials.I would anticipate at least a few people go in for this, especially first-time buyers of Apple Watches or Apple products generally.</p><p>This means now is the perfect time to build an app for the Apple Watch or a companion app for iOS. Doing so has never been easier, both to build the app and to integrate it with other Apple devices. Getting started now also means getting ahead of the curve, so by the time Series 7 is released, which will likely be a refinement of the major changes delivered this year, you can take full advantage of the latest Apple has to offer.</p><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/luke-chesser-vCF5sB7QecM-unsplash-1024x683.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-2210}</p><h2>What Can You Do Now?</h2><p>Since there's such a wide range of things you do with the new Watch, rather than try to wade through the technical possibilities, I've got three examples of apps that can be made with the new Watch that was not possible with older models/OS versions:</p><h3>Pizza Delivery</h3><p>This was a great idea that my recent guest to my podcast, Steve Lipton, casually mentioned. I think it makes a great example of a companion app that could make use of multiple complications and watch faces.</p><blockquote><p>I made an order form on a watch to order a pizza. In reality, that's not something that people will be doing is sitting there, scrolling away, trying to hit buttons. They'll do that on their phones. Instead, what they'll do is look at their watch and know where when the delivery time is going to be. Steve Lipton - Episode 63</p></blockquote><p>First off, given its size, you're not likely going to enjoy trying to order a pizza on the Watch (with maybe the exception of a repeat order that the app remembered) ---You'll still be wanting an iPhone or iPad. Once the order is made, however, the companion app could tell the customer, with a glance at their wrist:</p><ul><li>the status of their order</li><li>how long until delivery arrives</li><li>a map showing the delivery driver's progress</li><li>even a message alert from the driver</li></ul><h3>Sports Tracking App</h3><p>This takes advantage of the new multiple complications and watch faces. This app could conveniently let the user know the stats of, say, an ongoing hockey game while they are out walking their dog. With a single face (perhaps Stripes, Infograph, or Modular) you could have complications showing the time, score, as well as more detailed information like who scored the last goal or is in the penalty box. With WatchOS 7, displaying this relatively large amount of fast-moving data can be achieved relatively painlessly.</p><h3>Health &amp; Fitness Monitoring App</h3><p>I would be amiss if I didn't mention the potential of new health &amp; fitness apps for the Watch, something Apple itself heavily emphasized during the release with its Fitness+ workout service,</p><p><strong>With all these new features, you could have a watch-based 'cardiobot' that could track, display, and record various statistics related to the user's heart (heart rate, blood oxygen level, ECG).</strong> This could be helpful for someone out for a run focusing on maintaining an optimal heart rate. It could be equally helpful for a more sedentary user, alerting them to make sure they're drinking enough water, or when it would be a good idea to go out for a walk. It could even alert medical services if it detects an arrhythmia or dangerous slowing of the wearer's heart.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":349434,"title":"Apple Watch 2020 with Steve Lipton","episode<em>type":"full","number":63,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"September 19, 2020","duration":2962,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":49,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"49:22","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/21517a94/ac42f9f8.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/21517a94","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/episode/349434/thumb</em>1600348274-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this episode, Leo talks with Steve Lipton about the Apple Watch.

In this post, we be transforming the CLLocation publisher data into something useful using flatMap and the built-in publisher, Sequence.</p><ul><li><a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/combine-corelocation-publishers-delegates/">Creating Publishers from Delegates</a></li><li><a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/combine-corelocation-receiving-handling-events/">Using Function Reactive Programming to Transform Values</a></li><li><strong>Understanding FlatMap and Built-In Publishers</strong></li></ul><h2>Using Combine for Complex Transformations</h2><p>While we can simply assign the value from the authorizationPublisher to our authorizationStatus property, locationPublisher requires more work.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> CoreLocationObject: <span class="type">ObservableObject</span> {
  <span class="keyword">@Published var</span> location: <span class="type">CLLocation</span>?
  ...
}

<span class="keyword">protocol</span> CLLocationManagerCombineDelegate: <span class="type">CLLocationManagerDelegate</span> {
  <span class="keyword">func</span> locationPublisher() -&gt; <span class="type">AnyPublisher</span>&lt;[<span class="type">CLLocation</span>], <span class="type">Never</span>&gt;
  ...
}
</code></pre><p>While our locationPublisher returns a <code>[CLLocation]</code> result, our location property is <code>CLLocation?</code>.</p><p>That is to say we are going to need to do some functional programming to transform the result of our publisher:</p><ol><li>Turn the Array itself into a Sequential Publisher of each value</li><li>Use <code>flatMap</code> to return a new Publisher</li><li>Cast the CLLocation into the matching <code>CLLocation?</code> (i.e. <code>Optional&lt;CLLocation&gt;</code>)</li></ol><p>Here is our result:</p><pre><code>       locationPublisher
        <span class="comment">// convert the array of CLLocation into a Publisher itself</span>
        .<span class="call">flatMap</span>(<span class="type">Publishers</span>.<span class="type">Sequence</span>.<span class="keyword">init</span>(sequence:))
        <span class="comment">// in order to match the property map to Optional</span>

        <span class="comment">// since this is used in the UI,

        .<span class="call">receive</span>(on: <span class="type">DispatchQueue</span>.<span class="property">main</span>)
        <span class="comment">// store the value in the location property</span>
        .<span class="call">assign</span>(to: &amp;$location)
</code></pre><p>Let's break each of these steps down starting with</p><p><code>Publishers.Sequence</code>.</p><h3>Built-In Publishers from Combine</h3><p>Combine comes with several built-in Publishers we can use.</p><ul><li><code>Just</code> - single value</li><li><code>Future</code> - handling asynchronous callbacks</li><li><code>Sequence</code> - publishing individual values from a sequence in order</li></ul><p>We already talked about <code>Just</code> which takes in a single value. Another popular built-in publisher to use with asynchronous calls is <code>Future</code> which takes in a result type for when a call is completed. In this case, we are using <code>Sequence</code> which transforms a sequence type object into a Publisher stream of sequential values. Therefore when CLLocationManagerDelegate receives multiple locations, the publisher acts as if each location from that array received in order.</p><p>However, as <code>Just</code> is a Publisher so is <code>Sequence</code>, therefore we can not use <code>.map</code> but <code>.flatMap</code> since we want the values from the Publisher not the publisher itself. <code>flatMap</code> is especially powerful in Combine since it allows us to integrate Publishers from multiple technologies.</p><h3>Integrations in Combine</h3><p><a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/flatmap-double-optionals-functional-programming/">I've talked previously about what <code>flatMap</code> does in the functional sense whether that be Arrays or Optionals.</a> The same goes for Publishers as well.</p><p>Here's an example of a piece of code to download json from <strong><a href="https://baconipsum.com/json-api/">the Bacon Ipsum JSON API</a></strong>:</p><pre><code>   <span class="keyword">let</span> url = <span class="type">URL</span>(string: <span class="string">"https://baconipsum.com/api/?type=all-meat&amp;sentences=1&amp;format=json"</span>)!
   
  <span class="keyword">let</span> urlPublisher = <span class="type">URLSession</span>.<span class="property">shared</span>.<span class="call">dataTaskPublisher</span>(for: url)
    .<span class="call">map</span>(\.<span class="property">data</span>)
    .<span class="call">decode</span>(type: [<span class="type">String</span>].<span class="keyword">self</span>, decoder: <span class="type">JSONDecoder</span>())
    .<span class="call">replaceError</span>(with: [<span class="type">String</span>]())
    .<span class="dotAccess">compactMap</span>{ $0.<span class="property">first</span> }
</code></pre><p>This uses the dataTaskPublisher available on URLSession and transforms it to a single String. Here is step-by-step how:</p><ol><li>Create DataTaskPublisher from URL</li><li>Use the <code>map</code> function to get the <code>data</code> property from the tuple</li><li>Decode the JSON into an Array of Strings</li><li>In order to assign the value, we change the Failure type to Never. In this case, we are replacing each Error instance with an empty Array of Strings.</li><li>Lastly, we use compactMap to get the first string and therefore ignore all empty Arrays.</li></ol><p>Depending on your app and the data you are looking for, you'll want change the transformations and error handle but typically this is the basics for handling a data task in Combine.</p><h3>Combine System Publishers with <code>flatMap</code></h3><p>Along with URLSession.dataTaskPublisher there are other System publishers available to use:</p><ul><li><code>URLSession.dataTaskPublisher</code></li><li><code>NotificationCenter.publisher</code></li><li>Key Value Observation via <code>NSObject.publisher</code></li><li><code>Timer.publisher</code></li></ul><p>With this in mind, let's use the Timer publisher and use flatMap to update our String from the Bacon Ipsum JSON API at a regular interval. Firstly, let's create a Timer publisher:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> timerInterval:<span class="type">TimeInterval</span> = <span class="number">1.0</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> timerPublisher = <span class="type">Timer</span>.<span class="call">publish</span>(every: timerInterval, on: .<span class="dotAccess">current</span>, in: .<span class="dotAccess">default</span>)
      .<span class="call">autoconnect</span>()
</code></pre><p>In this instance, we are creating a Timer publisher on the current RunLoop using the default mode for every 1 second. Lastly is</p><p><code>autoconnect</code> which ensure the publisher connects when subscribed.</p><p>Now we can use flatMap to initiate a new dataTaskPublisher each second:</p><pre><code>timerPublisher.<span class="call">flatMap</span> {<span class="keyword">_ in</span> urlPublisher }
      .<span class="call">receive</span>(on: <span class="type">DispatchQueue</span>.<span class="property">main</span>)
      .<span class="call">assign</span>(to: &amp;$publishedStringProperty)
</code></pre><p>With this we can automate the assignment of the String value, as each dataTask is completed. In other words, our string property will update every second as the url is called.</p><p>Let's again take a look at our code for updating CLLocation:</p><pre><code>       locationPublisher
        <span class="comment">// convert the array of CLLocation into a Publisher itself</span>
        .<span class="call">flatMap</span>(<span class="type">Publishers</span>.<span class="type">Sequence</span>.<span class="keyword">init</span>(sequence:))
        <span class="comment">// in order to match the property map to Optional</span>
        .<span class="call">map</span> { $0 <span class="keyword">as</span> <span class="type">CLLocation</span>? }
        <span class="comment">// since this is used in the UI,
        //  it needs to be on the main DispatchQueue</span>
        .<span class="call">receive</span>(on: <span class="type">DispatchQueue</span>.<span class="property">main</span>)
        <span class="comment">// store the value in the location property</span>
        .<span class="call">assign</span>(to: &amp;$location)
</code></pre><p>By using Sequence to create a Publisher and flatMap to flatten and return the values from the Sequence Publisher, we have transformed the value from <code>[CLLocation]</code> to <code>CLLocation</code> without losing any data.</p><p>However the <code>location</code> property type and the Publisher result type must match. Therefore since our property takes into not having <code>CLLocation</code> as a possibility, we need to transform the <code>CLLocation</code> to an</p><p><code>Optional&lt;CLLocation&gt;</code> (i.e. <code>CLLocation?</code>).</p><h2>Combine with other Delegates</h2><p>While I've demonstrated how to use CoreLocation with Combine, this can be useful for other uses of Delegation APIs.</p><p>Recently, I've used these <em>Publicists</em> in my app, <a href="https://heartwitch.app">Heartwitch</a>, which is an Apple Watch app for broadcasting your heart rate to a live stream, as you are playing games or doing presentations. Likewise with HealthKit workouts, I've used the same pattern of creating publishers.</p><pre><code>...
    <span class="keyword">public let</span> coalesce: <span class="type">CoalescePublicist</span>
    <span class="keyword">public let</span> failurePublisist: <span class="type">FailurePublicist</span>
    <span class="keyword">public let</span> fullIdentifier: <span class="type">FullIdentifierPublicist</span>
    <span class="keyword">public let</span> metadata: <span class="type">MetadataPublicist</span>
    <span class="keyword">public let</span> optional: <span class="type">OptionalPublicist</span>
    <span class="keyword">public let</span> transition: <span class="type">TransitionPublicist</span>
    <span class="keyword">public let</span> workoutCreation: <span class="type">WorkoutCreationPublicist</span>
    <span class="keyword">public let</span> workoutDataUpdate: <span class="type">WorkoutDataUpdatePublicist</span>
    <span class="keyword">public let</span> workoutStart: <span class="type">WorkoutStartPublicist</span>
...
</code></pre><p>This same pattern can be used with other Delegation APIs such as:</p><ul><li>CoreBluetooth</li><li>UINotificationCenter</li><li>AVFoundation etc...</li></ul><h2>Other

In this post, we'll talk about how receiving and handling Events in our ObservableObject from our new Publicist class.</p><ul><li><a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/combine-corelocation-publishers-delegates/">Creating Publishers from Delegates</a></li><li><strong>Using Function Reactive Programming to Transform Values</strong></li><li><a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/combine-corelocation-swiftui-delegates/">Understanding flatMap and Built-In Publishers (Part 3)</a></li></ul><h2>Receiving and Handling Events in our ObservableObject</h2><p>Our <code>ObservableObject</code> needs to accomplish a few things to update our SwiftUI while listening to our <em>CoreLocation</em> publishers. First of all we need to:</p><ol><li>Create the CoreLocation Manager</li><li>Create our CoreLocation Publicist</li><li>Connect the Publicist as the Delegate of the Manager</li><li>Create our Authorization Status and Location Publishers</li></ol><p>With this in mind, here is how that looks:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> CoreLocationObject: <span class="type">ObservableObject</span> {
  <span class="keyword">@Published var</span> authorizationStatus = <span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>.<span class="property">notDetermined</span>
  <span class="keyword">@Published var</span> location: <span class="type">CLLocation</span>?

  <span class="keyword">let</span> manager: <span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> publicist: <span class="type">CLLocationManagerCombineDelegate</span>

  <span class="keyword">var</span> cancellables = [<span class="type">AnyCancellable</span>]()

  <span class="keyword">init</span>() {
    <span class="keyword">let</span> manager = <span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>()
    <span class="keyword">let</span> publicist = <span class="type">CLLocationManagerPublicist</span>()

    manager.<span class="property">delegate</span> = publicist

    <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">manager</span> = manager
    <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">publicist</span> = publicist

    <span class="keyword">let</span> authorizationPublisher = publicist.<span class="call">authorizationPublisher</span>()
    <span class="keyword">let</span> locationPublisher = publicist.<span class="call">locationPublisher</span>()
  ...
</code></pre><p>Next, we can actually deal with receiving and handling events from our Publishers. Firstly, let's deal with the <code>CLAuthorizationStatus</code>.</p><h2>Receiving and Handling Events with Sink and Assign</h2><p>As far the CLAuthorizationStatus, there are two things we need to do when the authorization status changes:</p><ul><li>Trigger Location Update when <code>CLAuthorizationStatus</code> is valid</li><li>Assign the <code>CLAuthorizationStatus</code> to our <code>@Published CLAuthorizationStatus</code> Property <code>authorizationStatus</code></li></ul><h3>Using Sink For Calling Methods</h3><p>Let's first deal with triggering location updates by creating a method to begin those updates:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> CoreLocationObject: <span class="type">ObservableObject</span> {
  <span class="keyword">@Published var</span> authorizationStatus = <span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>.<span class="property">notDetermined</span>
  <span class="keyword">@Published var</span> location: <span class="type">CLLocation</span>?

  <span class="keyword">let</span> manager: <span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>

...

  <span class="keyword">func</span> beginUpdates(<span class="keyword">_</span> authorizationStatus: <span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>) {
    <span class="keyword">if</span> authorizationStatus == .<span class="dotAccess">authorizedAlways</span> || authorizationStatus == .<span class="dotAccess">authorizedWhenInUse</span> {
      manager.<span class="call">startUpdatingLocation</span>()
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Our <code>beginUpdate</code> method will take in the <code>CLAuthorizedStatus</code> as it comes in from the <code>Publisher</code>. As a result, **if the status allows for location update then it calls <code>startUpdatingLocation</code> on the</p><p><code>CLLocationManager</code>.**</p><p>With this in mind, let's connect the <code>authorizationPublisher</code> to the</p><p><code>beginUpdates</code> method:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> CoreLocationObject: <span class="type">ObservableObject</span> {

  ...
  <span class="keyword">var</span> cancellables = [<span class="type">AnyCancellable</span>]()

  <span class="keyword">init</span>() {
    <span class="keyword">let</span> publicist = <span class="type">CLLocationManagerPublicist</span>()
   
    ...
    
    <span class="keyword">let</span> authorizationPublisher = publicist.<span class="call">authorizationPublisher</span>()

    <span class="comment">// trigger an update when authorization changes</span>
    authorizationPublisher
      .<span class="call">sink</span>(receiveValue: beginUpdates)
      .<span class="call">store</span>(in: &amp;cancellables)
  ...
</code></pre><p>In this case, we are using <code>sink</code> and passing a reference to our new method. <code>sink</code> returns a <code>Cancellable</code> which we'll need to make sure is disposed properly. Therefore, we use <code>.store</code> to make sure that</p><p><code>Cancellable</code> is stored correctly in our `cancelables` <code>Array</code>.</p><p>Now we should be correctly starting location updates when permission is granted. Next, let's store the <code>CLAuthorizationStatus</code> in our</p><p><code>@Published</code> property so we can display it in our SwiftUI view.</p><h3>Receiving and Handling Events with Assign (in iOS 13 and iOS 14)</h3><p><strong>One of the first things you learn as an iOS developer using UIKit is the importance of making UI updates on the main dispatch queue.</strong> In other words, failure to do this results in incorrect UI updates or even crashing your app. Likewise, in SwiftUI, you need to specify UI updates on the main dispatch queue. Therefore we can use <code>receive</code> to ensure updates are on the main <code>DispatchQueue</code>.</p><pre><code>...
      authorizationPublisher
        <span class="comment">// since this is used in the UI,
        //  it needs to be on the main DispatchQueue</span>
        .<span class="call">receive</span>(on: <span class="type">DispatchQueue</span>.<span class="property">main</span>)
    ...
</code></pre><p>As far as assigning we have a few options, we can stick with <code>sink</code> to assign our value the published property:</p><pre><code>...
      authorizationPublisher
        <span class="comment">// since this is used in the UI,
        //  it needs to be on the main DispatchQueue</span>
        .<span class="call">receive</span>(on: <span class="type">DispatchQueue</span>.<span class="property">main</span>)
    .<span class="call">sink</span>(receiveValue: {
          <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">authorizationStatus</span> = $0
        })
...
</code></pre><p>However, we could simplify this with <code>assign</code>:</p><pre><code>...
      authorizationPublisher
        <span class="comment">// since this is used in the UI,
        //  it needs to be on the main DispatchQueue</span>
        .<span class="call">receive</span>(on: <span class="type">DispatchQueue</span>.<span class="property">main</span>)
        <span class="comment">// store the value in the authorizationStatus property</span>
        .<span class="call">assign</span>(to: &amp;$authorizationStatus)

It's just as much a chance to connect directly with iOS developers as it is to find out what Apple has in store for us.</p><p>Just the same, Apple announced, via virtual conference, a lot of things we can feel excited about. Some things have the potential to really shift the way we create software.</p><p>Here's you need to know about what Apple revealed to us about what they've been working on.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_0091-577x1024.png"/>{.wp-image-2154 width="289" height="512"} :::</p><h2>iOS 14 gives us a lot more smart, a little bit less phone</h2><p>Far and away, the most exciting announcements from Apple are coming in with iOS 14. WWDC 2020 appears to be the year where having a big screen has become a central issue for iPhone design. Likewise, <strong>the iPhone is less about making calls and more about having a small, smart device in your pocket.</strong> This is perhaps best demonstrated by phone calls no longer taking up the whole screen when in use (Siri doesn't either).</p><p>Here's a few other things that are going to matter with iOS 14 that we've found in the beta version:</p><h2>Some of the best ideas come from your competition</h2><p>With this rethink about what the phone screen is for, Apple offers things that will be familiar to Android users: widgets, app clips, and default app selection.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IOS_14_Homescreen.png"/>{.wp-image-2153} :::</p><h3>Widgets</h3><p>This feature is one Android users have been able to enjoy for years, and now it's coming to Apple - especially for the iPhone. This makes sense with the purpose of the iPhone being less about making calls. The iPhone has become more of a source of information that you can easily place at. These widgets will come in all kinds of sizes and, will look better than anything we've ever had in older iOS versions. Additonally, the iPhone will even be able to stack widgets on the app screen intellegently, based on user behavior and settings.</p><h4>SwiftUI continues to improve at WWDC 2020</h4><p>SwiftUI is now a year old. And at WWDC 2020 they announced new improvements and additions for the new releases. You can build an entire app now within SwiftUI, without needing to resort to any of the older APIs. With the introduction of widgets and build complications, Apple made WidgetKit available only via SwiftUI, their API for building Widgets.</p><p><em>If you are interested in learning more about SwiftUI from WWDC 2020, check out <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/44dc8297">our episodes with Majid Jabrayilov on EmpowerApps.Show</a>.</em></p><p>Apple has designed their widgets to be flexible and compatible across all their devices. So the small widget is conveniently the same size as the standard watchOS interface. While the large version of the same widget could fit comfortably on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. It's your choice as a developer in which sizes you want to support. On top of that, Apple enabled the use of "stacks" and "smart stacks". These "stacks" allow you to layer different widgets over each other and order them according to user preference and behavior.</p><h3>App Clips</h3><p>Another smart idea that is coming over from the Android world is App Clips. App Clips are basically "previews" of full apps. They enable you to quickly download and temporarily check out an app. For instance, you want to try a new food delivery app. You may not want to compare it against the one you already have. Additionally, you may only use the app one instance and never need it again. You can use the App Clip to try it out and decide if you want to keep it. This reduces cluttering up your phone app screens and data storage.</p><h3>Default Apps</h3><p>It boggles the mind that we've never been able to choose which app runs by default when opening files or doing routine tasks on the iPhone (something that Android and Mac users take for granted). Now we will on iOS 14, and that can only be a good thing, for developers and consumers alike.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/macOS-Big-Sur-1024x576.jpg"/>{.wp-image-2163} :::</p><h2>Apple Silicon: New chips for a new era for the Mac</h2><p>After years of using Intel-built processors for the Mac, Apple is transitioning to using their own Apple Silicon CPUs. This is a monumental shift for Apple. They've already demonstrated that these 64-bit ARM-based chips can easily match the speed of comparative Intel chips while drawing less power on other devices.</p><p>What we can expect in the next 10-15 years are Macs that have better performance per watt and high-performance GPUs. This is all great news for app developers, especially for those making professional apps and games. While it will take some time for these new chips to roll out, we can expect they'll be everywhere within two years.</p><h3>macOS 11 at WWDC 2020</h3><p>Aside from the new chips, the new version of macOS, known as Big Sur, features a UI redesign. The redesign is in line with the updates I mentioned above with iOS and iPadOS (widgets, better navigation). There's also changes to Safari Web Extensions, allowing you to set when and where an extension is used in Safari, as opposed to simply being "on" all the time.</p><p><em>If you are interested in learning more about changes to macOS from WWDC 2020, check out <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/416088a5">our episodes with Lucas Derraugh on EmpowerApps.Show</a>.</em></p><h2>After WWDC 2020, Privacy Policy Now A Must-Have</h2><p>App developers now <strong>must</strong> include a privacy policy with their apps. Additionally, Apple has gone to a lot of effort to make this clear and concise. I think we can all agree that anything that makes our apps earn more trust from users should always be a high priority.</p><p>Amongst other things, users will be able to set how precisely an app can see their location. It will also be clearer how apps use different parts of the hardware, such as the microphone or camera.</p><h3>iPadOS 14 also seeing some great new features</h3><p>Much like iOS 14, iPadOS 14 is getting a few nice updates to its features. The ones I think that are worth paying attention to include UI improvements. Most importantly, these introduce sidebars that make the interface navigation much easier to use (similar to macOS), as well as the widgets included on the iPhone. There are also updates to the platform's LiDAR scanner, which will be helpful for those of developing apps that need to measure distance. Lastly, Apple made a big improvement to the Apple Pencil with Scribble. Scribble has the ability to convert written notes to typed text and recognize basic drawn shapes. This could be amazing for people, who prefer the tactile experience of writing by hand, for notes or marking up documents quickly.</p><h2>With WWDC 2020, the future of Apple app development looks bright</h2><p>WWDC is almost always an exciting event, and this year was no exception, despite none of us being able to attend in person. There are some really clear, intelligent changes coming to Apple and its platforms. These changes are going to make building apps faster and easier. They will also open us up to including some great functionality that we've never had before.</p><h2>Is your app ready for these changes?</h2><p>All of these announcements from WWDC 2020 mean things are changing for how we develop or update apps for the Apple ecosystem.

How do we adapt those APIs for SwiftUI and create Publishers from delegates?</description><link>https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/combine-corelocation-publishers-delegates</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 20:31:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of the APIs from Apple come from an era of Objective-C and the Delegation Pattern. With this in mind, the challenge is figuring how to adapt for SwiftUI. Specifically we want to create Publishers from delegates using Combine.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://heartwitch.app">my app Heartwitch is an Apple Watch app for live streamers</a>. In this case, It uses HealthKit which implants the delegation pattern frequently. Additionally, I am using newer technologies such as Vapor 4, Independent Watch Apps, and most importantly SwiftUI.</p><hr><p>I recently covered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkFxOlmLWoA">this topic at 360iDev 2020</a>, so in this series of articles, I'd like to go into detail regarding the process. That is the process of adapting an older API for Combine. Specifically <strong>we are going to be building a basic SwiftUI app which displays your latitude and longitude with CoreLocation.</strong> This includes:</p><ul><li>Creating Publishers from Delegates</li><li><a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/combine-corelocation-receiving-handling-events/">Using Function Reactive Programming to Transform Values (Part 2)</a></li><li><a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/combine-corelocation-swiftui-delegates/">Understanding FlatMap and Built-In Publishers (Part 3)</a></li></ul><p>::: {.wp-block-group} ::: {.wp-block-group__inner-container} For this part, we'll be getting into how to create a <code>Protocol</code> and</p><p><code>Class</code> which will act as a go-between for the <em>Delegation Pattern</em> and the <em>Reactive Functional Programming</em> of <strong>SwiftUI</strong> and <strong>Combine</strong>.</p><h2>Gonna Delegate Like It's 2009</h2><p>For over a decade, Apple frequently used the Delegation Pattern for giving developers the ability to respond, update, and act in place of a UI object. This pattern has a plethora of benefits especially in Objective-C. However, with Swift and especially SwiftUI, this pattern becomes awkward.</p><p>This is where it becomes necessary to make a delegate respond in such a way that SwiftUI can handle updates.</p><p>With Apple's older APIs, we typically see this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">protocol</span> NSDelegate : <span class="type">NSObjectProtocol</span> {
  <span class="keyword">func</span> manager(<span class="keyword">_</span> manager: <span class="type">NSManager</span>, doneWith data: <span class="type">AnyObject</span>)
  <span class="keyword">func</span> manager(<span class="keyword">_</span> manager: <span class="type">NSManager</span>, grantedPermission: <span class="type">Bool</span>)
}
<span class="keyword">class</span> NSManager : <span class="type">NSObject</span> {
  <span class="keyword">weak var</span> delegate : <span class="type">NSDelegate</span>?
  
  <span class="keyword">func</span> requestAuthorization() {}
  <span class="keyword">func</span> doThing () {}
}
</code></pre><p>In the case of <strong>CoreLocation</strong> we see this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">protocol</span> CLLocationManagerDelegate : <span class="type">NSObjectProtocol</span> {
  <span class="keyword">func</span> locationManager(_: <span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>, didUpdateLocations locations: [<span class="type">CLLocation</span>])
  <span class="keyword">func</span> locationManager(_: <span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>, didChangeAuthorization status: <span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>)
}
<span class="keyword">class</span> CLLocationManager : <span class="type">NSObject</span> {
  <span class="keyword">weak var</span> delegate : <span class="type">CLLocationManagerDelegate</span>?
  
  <span class="keyword">func</span> requestWhenInUseAuthorization() {}
  <span class="keyword">func</span> startUpdatingLocation () {}
}
</code></pre><p>In other words, we'll need to create Combine <em>Publishers</em> which our</p><p><code>ObservableObject</code> can listen or react to. Once the <code>ObservableObject</code> reacts properly, then the <code>View</code> will update accordingly. In the end, we should see this in our application:</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/CoreLocation-AppPreview-300x125.jpg"/>{.wp-image-1036} :::</p><p>Before we setup our publishers, let's scaffold our <code>View</code> and</p><p><code>ObservableObject</code>. ::: :::</p><p>::: {.wp-block-group} ::: {.wp-block-group__inner-container}</p><h2>SwiftUI Scaffolding</h2><p>Let's first start by building our SwiftUI View. In this case, we'll be creating a SwiftUI view along with an <code>ObservableObject</code>.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> LocationView: <span class="type">View</span> {
  <span class="comment">// CLLocationManager is basically a singleton so an EnvironmentObject ObservableObject makes sense</span>

        <span class="type">Text</span>($0.<span class="property">description</span>)
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>This <code>LocationView</code> will simply display one line with a description of the location with a line describing the <code>CLAuthorizationStatus</code> using this extension:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">extension</span> <span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>: <span class="type">CustomStringConvertible</span> {

    <span class="keyword">@unknown default</span>:
      <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">"🤷‍♂️"</span>
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Now let's go ahead and define our <code>ObservableObject</code>, named</p><p><code>CoreLocationObject</code>:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">import</span> Combine
<span class="keyword">import</span> CoreLocation
<span class="keyword">import</span> SwiftUI

  <span class="keyword">@Published var</span> location: <span class="type">CLLocation</span>?
  <span class="keyword">init</span>() { }
}
</code></pre><p>Lastly, make sure that you set the <code>EnvironmentObject</code> in your application using:</p><pre><code><span class="type">LocationView</span>().<span class="call">environmentObject</span>(<span class="type">CoreLocationObject</span>())
</code></pre><p>Now, we have our scaffolding setup, let's plug-in <em>CoreLocation</em>. ::: :::</p><h2>Extending Delegates into Combine Publishers</h2><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Combine-ing-the-Old-with-the-New-360iDev-August-2020.001-2-1024x538.png"/><p>{.wp-image-1040}</p><p>With the Delegation Pattern, the Delegate (in this case</p><p><code>CoreLocationManagerDelegate</code>) will receive location updates.

</code></pre><p>In the case of our application, we are displaying the authorization status of <em>Core Location</em> as well as the latitude and longitude. Therefore, we only need two methods implemented for our publishers.</p><p>Here is the implementation of our new protocol:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> CLLocationManagerPublicist: <span class="type">NSObject</span>, <span class="type">CLLocationManagerCombineDelegate</span> {
  <span class="keyword">let</span> authorizationSubject = <span class="type">PassthroughSubject</span>&lt;<span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>, <span class="type">Never</span>&gt;()
  <span class="keyword">let</span> locationSubject = <span class="type">PassthroughSubject</span>&lt;[<span class="type">CLLocation</span>], <span class="type">Never</span>&gt;()
  <span class="keyword">func</span> authorizationPublisher() -&gt; <span class="type">AnyPublisher</span>&lt;<span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>, <span class="type">Never</span>&gt; {
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="type">Just</span>(<span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>.<span class="call">authorizationStatus</span>())
      .<span class="call">merge</span>(with:
        authorizationSubject.<span class="call">compactMap</span> { $0 }
      ).<span class="call">eraseToAnyPublisher</span>()
  }
  <span class="keyword">func</span> locationPublisher() -&gt; <span class="type">AnyPublisher</span>&lt;[<span class="type">CLLocation</span>], <span class="type">Never</span>&gt; {
    <span class="keyword">return</span> locationSubject.<span class="call">eraseToAnyPublisher</span>()
  }
  <span class="keyword">func</span> locationManager(_: <span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>, didUpdateLocations locations: [<span class="type">CLLocation</span>]) {
    locationSubject.<span class="call">send</span>(locations)
  }
  <span class="keyword">func</span> locationManager(_: <span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>, didFailWithError _: <span class="type">Error</span>) {
    <span class="comment">// Implement to avoid crashes
    // Extra Credit: Create a publisher for errors :/</span>
  }
  <span class="keyword">func</span> locationManager(_: <span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>, didChangeAuthorization status: <span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>) {
    authorizationSubject.<span class="call">send</span>(status)
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Let's breakdown how this class works.</p><h2>The Power of Type Erasing Publishers</h2><p>**Our Publicist doesn't need to hold onto any values. In the end, it solely serves the purpose of transforming data from the</p><p><code>CoreLocationManager</code> to the <code>ObservableObject</code>.** For this reason, we'll be using a <code>PassthroughSubject</code> for the <code>CLLocation</code> and</p><p><code>CLAuthorizationStatus</code>. That is to say, <code>PassthroughSubject</code> doesn't hold any values as they receive values but passes them on.</p><p>With the <code>PassthroughSubject</code> properties in place, our delegate can send the values received from the delegate methods to the subjects.</p><p>Creating our first <em>publisher</em> for <code>CLLocation</code> is fairly simple:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> CLLocationManagerPublicist: <span class="type">NSObject</span>, <span class="type">CLLocationManagerCombineDelegate</span> {
...
  <span class="keyword">let</span> locationSubject = <span class="type">PassthroughSubject</span>&lt;[<span class="type">CLLocation</span>], <span class="type">Never</span>&gt;()
  <span class="keyword">func</span> locationPublisher() -&gt; <span class="type">AnyPublisher</span>&lt;[<span class="type">CLLocation</span>], <span class="type">Never</span>&gt; {
    <span class="keyword">return</span> locationSubject.<span class="call">eraseToAnyPublisher</span>()
  }
  <span class="keyword">func</span> locationManager(_: <span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>, didUpdateLocations locations: [<span class="type">CLLocation</span>]) {
    locationSubject.<span class="call">send</span>(locations)
  }
...
}
</code></pre><p>What's important to realize is that we need to implement type erasure using <code>eraseToAnyPublisher</code>. The introduction of SwiftUI and Combine included improvements to Swift. These improvement allow for powerful transformations which can result in fairly complex Generic Types. For instance our <code>authorizationPublisher</code> has a return type <code>AnyPublisher</code>:</p><pre><code>   <span class="keyword">func</span> authorizationPublisher() -&gt; <span class="type">AnyPublisher</span>&lt;<span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>, <span class="type">Never</span>&gt; {
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="type">Just</span>(<span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>.<span class="call">authorizationStatus</span>())
      .<span class="call">merge</span>(with:
        authorizationSubject.<span class="call">compactMap</span> { $0 }
      ).<span class="call">eraseToAnyPublisher</span>()
  }
</code></pre><p>Without <code>eraseToAnyPublisher</code>, the return type would be:</p><pre><code><span class="type">Publishers</span>.<span class="type">Merge</span>&lt;<span class="type">Just</span>&lt;<span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>&gt;, <span class="type">Publishers</span>.<span class="type">CompactMap</span>&lt;<span class="type">PassthroughSubject</span>&lt;<span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>, <span class="type">Never</span>&gt;, <span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>&gt;&gt;
</code></pre><p>Likewise with the <code>locationPublisher</code>, the return type would be:</p><pre><code><span class="type">PassthroughSubject</span>&lt;[<span class="type">CLLocation</span>], <span class="type">Never</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>In the end, this makes creating Protocols and Return Types fairly complex. <strong>As far as the <code>ObservableObject</code> is concerned, it doesn't care how the publisher is transformed but the result types returned.</strong></p><p>Therefore our Protocol only needs a <code>AnyPublisher</code> return type. In the end, we can both simplify and hide the method of functional transformation using <code>eraseToAnyPublisher</code>. Likewise, the implementation calls <code>eraseToAnyPublisher</code> to reduce the return type and match the Protocol's method signature.</p><p>Now that we have figured out how to creating matching Publisher types, let's transform <code>CLAuthorizationStatu</code>s so it is usable within the view.</p><h2>Transforming Authorization Status into a Publisher</h2><p>While our <code>locationSubject</code> reflects the values from <em>CoreLocation</em>, the</p><p><code>authorizationSubject</code> will be out of sync from the reality of <em>CoreLocation</em>'s status. For this reason, we'll need to write some code include the initial status along with whatever the <code>PassthroughSubject</code> receives.</p><pre><code>   <span class="keyword">func</span> authorizationPublisher() -&gt; <span class="type">AnyPublisher</span>&lt;<span class="type">CLAuthorizationStatus</span>, <span class="type">Never</span>&gt; {
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="type">Just</span>(<span class="type">CLLocationManager</span>.<span class="call">authorizationStatus</span>())
      .<span class="call">merge</span>(with:
        authorizationSubject
      ).<span class="call">eraseToAnyPublisher</span>()
  }
</code></pre><p>While <code>CoreLocationManagerDelegate</code> sends updates to</p><p><code>authorizationStatus</code>, we need to have access to the initial status via</p><p><code>CLLocationManager.authorizedStatus</code>. Luckily, Combine includes a built-in <em>Publisher</em> for single values using <code>Just</code>.</p><p><code>Just</code> gives us the initial value published however we need to include the remaining published values from our <code>PassthroughSubject</code>. For this reason, we can use <code>merge</code> to join the intial value with the result from the our <code>authorizationSubject</code>:</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/optimized.gif"/>{.wp-image-1044} :::</p><p>We have the publisher factories setup now!</p><h2>What's Next?</h2><p>In our next part in this series, we'll learn how to use this implementation in our <code>ObservableObject</code> <code>CoreLocationObject</code>. <strong>Specifically, we'll be getting into power of function programming within Reactive Functional Programming.</strong> Enjoy!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/swift-on-arm-supporting-arm-in-swift-package-ci</guid><title>swift-on-arm-supporting-arm-in-swift-package-ci</title><description>In this article, I'm going to go over how to setup your CI and install Swift in Travis-CI and GitHub Actions for ARM architectures.</description><link>https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/swift-on-arm-supporting-arm-in-swift-package-ci</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2020 14:01:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/swift-package-continuous-integration-guide/">a previous post,</a> I already talked about how to setup your Swift package for CI success. However, I recently came across how to run your CI in Travis and GitHub Actions to test on Linux ARM machines. In this article, I'm going to go over how to setup your Linux CI for ARM architecture as well as how to install Swift on those ARM machines.</p><h2>ARM in Travis-CI</h2><p>Currently on Travis-CI, different CPU architectures are supported in an alpha stage. However it is fairly easy to setup. Within your</p><p><code>travis-ci.yml</code> file, simply specify your CPU architecture. For instance, if you'd like to test on both with a build matrix, you can start your file with:</p><pre><code>arch:
  - amd64
  - arm64
os: linux  # different <span class="type">CPU</span> architectures are only supported on <span class="type">Linux</span>
</code></pre><p>As you can see we are using the default version of Linux supported by Travis-CI. If you wish to expand your matrix, and specify different versions of Ubuntu, you can by:</p><pre><code>jobs:
  include:
    - os: linux
      dist: bionic
      arch: amd64
    - os: linux
      dist: focal
      arch: amd64
    - os: linux
      dist: bionic
      arch: arm64
    - os: linux
      dist: focal
      arch: arm64
</code></pre><p>This will allow us to test on four VMs each using Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 while testing both x86/AMD64 and 64-bit ARM.</p><h2>ARM in GitHub Actions</h2><p>Likewise, in GitHub Actions, you can do this, however you'll need to use QEMU to emulate the ARM architecture. Luckily there's a <a href="https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action">GitHub Action</a> to simplify this. Using <a href="https://github.com/uraimo/run-on-arch-action">this run-on-arch-action</a>, we then add a script to install Swift and run our test.</p><p>For instance, I will setup a separate workflow file for ARM <code>arm.yml</code>. Inside I setup a build matrix for each version of Ubuntu as well as for ARM. As we'll see there are separate procedures for installing Swift on ARM, which we'll need to follow. Therefore, it's best to keep a separate workflow file for arm as opposed to standard x86.</p><p>Inside the workflow file <code>arm.yml</code>, I start off with:</p><pre><code>name: arm

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    env:
      <span class="type">PACKAGE_NAME</span>: {{ <span class="type">Insert Package Name Here</span> }}
      <span class="type">SWIFT_VER</span>: <span class="number">5.2.4</span>

    strategy:
      matrix:
        architecture:  [aarch64]
        distribution: [ubuntu16.<span class="number">04</span>,ubuntu18.<span class="number">04</span>,ubuntu20.<span class="number">04</span>]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: <span class="type">Build</span> with <span class="type">Swift</span> on arm
      uses: uraimo/run-on-arch-action@master
      env:
         {{ any environment keys here }}
      with:
        architecture: ${{ matrix.<span class="property">architecture</span> }}
        distribution: ${{ matrix.<span class="property">distribution</span> }}
        run: |
...
</code></pre><p>Now we have the beginning of the setup for Travis-CI and GitHub for ARM on Linux. However, the challenge will be installing Swift.</p><h2>Preparing Swift on ARM</h2><p>Before running your test and building your Swift package, you need make sure your CI instance is ready. This includes installing prerequisites and installing Swift. There are a few differences in preparing your instance on GitHub and Travis-CI due to how they implement the different CPU architectures. However I will do my best to note those differences below.</p><h3>Installing Prerequisites on GitHub</h3><p>Since Travis-CI uses LXD and the GitHub Action uses QEMU, it seems GitHub requires more prerequisites to install Swift.</p><p>With Travis-CI, we can simply follow guidelines of what required for various Linux distributions. However GitHub needs a few other requirements:</p><ul><li><code>curl</code>, <code>sudo</code> which are need for installation are not included</li><li><code>tzdata</code> which is required for installing Swift requires the time zone be set beforehand. Otherwise, the installation will stall on a terminal dialog.</li><li>In order dynamically install prerequisites based on Linux distribution, we need <code>lsb_release</code> installing to do some logic in our script.</li></ul><p>Therefore before installing our prerequisites we need to do this:</p><pre><code># tell the installation this <span class="keyword">is</span> non-interactive
          export <span class="type">DEBIAN_FRONTEND</span>=noninteractive
# <span class="keyword">set</span> your time zone here
          ln -fs /usr/share/zoneinfo/<span class="type">America</span>/<span class="type">New_York</span> /etc/localtime
# install sudo, curl, lab-release, and clang
          apt update
          apt install -y curl lsb-release sudo clang
# grab the release name, number <span class="keyword">in</span> dot (<span class="number">18.04</span>) and non-dot (<span class="number">1804</span> format
          <span class="type">RELEASE_DOT</span>=$(lsb_release -sr)
          <span class="type">RELEASE_NUM</span>=${<span class="type">RELEASE_DOT</span><span class="comment">//[-._]/}</span>
          <span class="type">RELEASE_NAME</span>=$(lsb_release -sc)
</code></pre><h3>Installing Swift Prerequisites</h3><p>Following <a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift">the guidelines provided by the Swift team,</a> we can simply check the Ubuntu version and install our prerequisites. Here's a snippet which checks for Ubuntu Focal Fossa 20.04, and installs the required packages:</p><pre><code>           <span class="keyword">if</span> [[ $RELEASE_DOT == <span class="string">"20.04"</span> ]]; then
            sudo apt-<span class="keyword">get</span> -y install \
                    binutils \
                    git \
                    gnupg2 \
                    libc6-dev \
                    libcurl4 \
                    libedit2 \
                    libgcc-<span class="number">9</span>-dev \
                    libpython2.<span class="number">7</span> \
                    libsqlite3-<span class="number">0</span> \
                    libstdc++-<span class="number">9</span>-dev \
                    libxml2 \
                    libz3-dev \
                    pkg-config \
                    tzdata \
                    zlib1g-dev
            elif [[ $RELEASE_DOT == <span class="string">"16.04"</span> ]]; then
...
</code></pre><p>On GitHub, after installing <code>tzdata</code> make sure run:</p><pre><code>dpkg-reconfigure --frontend noninteractive tzdata
</code></pre><p>Now we can move forward with actually installing Swift.</p><h3>Installing Swift on ARM</h3><p>Installing Swift on ARM will simply need adding the repository and installing via <code>apt</code>:</p><pre><code>curl -s https://packagecloud.<span class="property">io</span>/install/repositories/swift-arm/release/script.<span class="property">deb</span>.<span class="property">sh</span> | sudo bash
apt-<span class="keyword">get</span> install -y swift5
</code></pre><p>While typically, you may need to add the <code>PATH</code>, since we are using</p><p><code>apt-get install</code> <code>swift</code> is already added to our path.</p><p>If you are using a single script on Travis-CI for both amd64 and arm64, you can use some logic to differentiate the installation process using the <code>TRAVIS_CPU_ARCH</code> variable:</p><pre><code>   <span class="keyword">if</span> [[ $TRAVIS_CPU_ARCH == <span class="string">"arm64"</span> ]]; then
    curl -s https://packagecloud.<span class="property">io</span>/install/repositories/swift-arm/release/script.<span class="property">deb</span>.<span class="property">sh</span> | sudo bash
    sudo apt-<span class="keyword">get</span> install swift5
  <span class="keyword">else</span>
     wget https://swift.<span class="property">org</span>/builds/swift-${<span class="type">SWIFT_VER</span>}-release/ubuntu${<span class="type">RELEASE_NUM</span>}/swift-${<span class="type">SWIFT_VER</span>}-<span class="type">RELEASE</span>/swift-${<span class="type">SWIFT_VER</span>}-<span class="type">RELEASE</span>-ubuntu${<span class="type">RELEASE_DOT</span>}.tar.<span class="property">gz</span>
     tar xzf swift-${<span class="type">SWIFT_VER</span>}-<span class="type">RELEASE</span>-ubuntu${<span class="type">RELEASE_DOT</span>}.tar.<span class="property">gz</span>
  fi 
</code></pre><p>For this point, you can run <code>swift build</code> or <code>swift test</code> easily in your CI's build process.</p><h2>Getting Ready for Swift on ARM</h2><p>With the increased use of ARM on a variety of devices, it's important to make sure your Swift package works everywhere. For instance, you may want to build an IOT device and make sure your package works on a Raspberry PI. If that's the case, this is great way to get started. If you'd like more guidance, feel free to look at my current example on EggSeed and other Swift Packages. Once this is implemented on your CI setup, you can be confident your Swift package is ARM-ready.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid

The technology has come a long way since it was first released. <strong>With the release of its latest operating system, watchOS 6, I believe this is the year the Apple Watch will come into its own.</strong> 2020 is when it moves from being a curiosity and a status object to a useful device for everyone.</p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/daniel-canibano-JE3ASpuEld4-unsplash-1.jpg?fit=640%2C263&ssl=1"/><p>{.wp-image-2024}</p><p>If you're thinking about building an app for the Watch, read on: <strong>this article is for you. </strong></p><p>I'll be covering:</p><ul><li>why and how the Apple Watch has improved</li><li>where it still needs improvement</li><li>and what you need to know to decide **if a watch app is a good idea for your business**</li></ul><h2>Hearts &amp; Minds: What the Apple Watch is good for.</h2><p><strong>There are two core areas where the Watch can excel: health and location.</strong></p><p>With so many of us using our personal data to become fitter and healthier, the Watch represents an opportunity. watchOS 6 makes things a lot easier when creating watch apps that help you measure data about your body: everything from...</p><ul><li>exercise time and speed</li><li>heart rate to your breathing</li><li>sleep patterns</li><li>or menstrual cycle</li></ul><p>It's relatively straightforward to design an app that allows you to input the data via the Watch, as well as have the watch passively record information while you're active.</p><p>Secondly, <strong>there is potential to incorporate location-based tools that could be useful for business.</strong> It's now easy to imagine your watch tracking shipments and deliveries, or letting your customer know how far away their delivery is on their watch. What if your watch could help you navigate a building you're unfamiliar with, so you know you'll arrive on time for a meeting? In another situation, a nurse could find out where a doctor is in the hospital. It would mean not having to page them because they could see they're seeing a patient or doing surgery.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":67233,"title":"WWDC 2019 - Apple Watch with Gary Sabo","episode<em>type":"full","number":18,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"July 28, 2019","duration":2489,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":41,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"41:29","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/3d4c7634/09170915.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/3d4c7634","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/122/thumb</em>1533929410-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this episode we talk with Gary Sabo about the Apple Watch post-WWDC 2019.

The <em>always-on</em> display introduced in the last couple of releases, while improving usability, also doesn't seem to have helped battery usage like Apple hoped it would. <strong>With so many apps needing direct connections to the internet -- a relatively energy-intensive task -- the battery will need to be improved if it's going to succeed in the long term.</strong></p><p>At the same time, while the sensor capabilities the current Watch series are powerful, they can still be less than reliable, notably when it comes to movement and speed. That said, we are still very much in the infancy of wearable technology, so it is reasonable to expect these to improve and new sensors to be added: as an example, for the last few years we've seen demos of watches that can help you monitor your blood sugar levels -- a boon for diabetics.</p><p>Finally, while I'm expecting this to change very soon at the time of writing, Apple has not yet deployed StoreKit to the Watch -- the framework we use for functions related to the App Store. This will be necessary if Apple wants to develop the Watch 'app ecosystem' and make it easy to deploy, buy, and install apps on the Watch itself.</p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-23-at-2.46.07-PM.png?fit=640%2C400&ssl=1" alt="Building an Apple Watch app in Xcode"/><p>{.wp-image-2020}</p><h2>So you want to build a Watch app?</h2><p><strong>Businesses and organizations related to areas I've covered above, especially health &amp; fitness, are most likely to benefit from the Apple Watch and its new operating system.</strong> There are a few considerations I think everyone should take into account before committing to a new app:</p><h3>Battery usage... again</h3><p>The first consideration is, what kind of resources will your app need, specifically related to the limitations of the current battery? If your app needs frequent or constant connectivity to the cloud or a server, you may find the results a little disappointing. Your users will likely love the performance of a Watch app but will struggle with how quickly the Watch runs out of juice.</p><p>If this is a critical need to serve your customers, <strong>my recommendation is to wait perhaps another year for Apple to tackle this challenge and see what hardware improvements they deliver.</strong></p><h3>Is it going to take a long time to build?</h3><p>Another thing to think about is how long it will take to build and deploy your new app. With the release of independent Watch apps and (hopefully) the imminent release of StoreKit for the Watch, the Apple development community is expecting a number of important changes and improvements. This may alter the needs or requirements of your app.</p><h3>To SwiftUI or not to SwiftUI</h3><p>I recently covered <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/02/04/swiftui-everything-is-possible-if-you-think-like-apple/">the significance of SwiftUI</a> and how it's going to change the way we build user interfaces on Apple platforms, which I recommend <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/02/04/swiftui-everything-is-possible-if-you-think-like-apple/">you skim if you're unfamiliar</a>. <strong>The key takeaway is if you're able to work within the restrictions of SwiftUI, it will make it easier (and probably cheaper) to create and deliver an app to your customers where they will find the same quality experience on their Macs, iPhones, iPads, and Watches. </strong></p><h3>Think about your customer's wallet</h3><p>Finally, a new Apple Watch isn't cheap, so it's not going to be for everyone. <strong>A brand-new small size Series 5 Watch will set you back around $400; an even older Series 3 costs around $200.</strong> Now, for a lot of the benefits I've covered above, this is less important than the release of the latest operating system, but you will want to consider factors like screen size and whether your app will need the latest hardware. I recommend, before you build the app, carefully considering your own user base and their device usage: <strong>Do they already mostly own Watches, and will they really get a lot out of having your app on them?</strong></p><h2>Want to keep track of the latest Apple Watch developments?</h2><p><strong>If you're interested in keeping up to date with what happens with the Watch, and Apple-based app development, I invite you to <a href="https://brightdigit.com/subscribe/">sign up for my newsletter</a> or check out <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/category/watch/">our latest posts on developing for the Apple Watch</a>.</strong> I will let you know when I put out new content and if there are important things you should know when it comes to creating or updating your apps.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/flatmap-double-optionals-functional-programming</guid><title>flatmap-double-optionals-functional-programming</title><description>It seems there's some confusion when it comes to flatMap and Optionals.

However, it seems there's some confusion as to how one particular method works in Swift when it comes to a collection of <strong>Optionals</strong>: <em>flatMap</em>.</p><p>With all the talk regarding <em>flattening the curve</em>, today I want to explain exactly what it means to flatten in the context of functional programming. Additionally, it not only can be used on <strong>Arrays</strong> but single <strong>Optionals</strong> as well. In the end, using them correctly will make your code easier to read.</p><h2>flatMap vs map and Generic</h2><p>Before we dive into what <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> does, let's talk about <strong>what flatten actually means</strong>. Most importantly, <em>flatMap</em> is typically a <em>map</em> coupled with a <em>flatten</em> operation. The flatten operation typically is used in the context of <strong>Generics</strong>, such as <strong>Arrays</strong>, <strong>Promises</strong>, <strong>Publishers</strong>, and even <strong>Optionals</strong> (<em>remember Optionals are Generic enums</em>).</p><p>Let's create our own Generic to show how this would work:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> Foo&lt;Value&gt; {
  <span class="keyword">let</span> value : <span class="type">Value</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Here's a simple Generic <code>Foo</code> which contains a value. Therefore, let's add a simple map function in case the developer wants to convert the value into something else:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">extension</span> <span class="type">Foo</span> {
  <span class="keyword">func</span> map&lt;Output&gt;( <span class="keyword">_</span> callback: (<span class="type">Value</span>) -&gt; (<span class="type">Output</span>) ) -&gt; <span class="type">Foo</span>&lt;<span class="type">Output</span>&gt; {
    <span class="keyword">let</span> output = <span class="call">callback</span>(<span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">value</span>)
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="type">Foo</span>&lt;<span class="type">Output</span>&gt;(value : output)
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Now we have simple map method which works similar to others, where the developer can convert the <code>Foo</code> into some other type. For instance:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> firstItem = <span class="type">Foo</span>(value: <span class="number">3.0</span>)
<span class="keyword">let</span> secondItem = firstItem.<span class="property">map</span>{ $0.<span class="property">description</span> }
</code></pre><p>In this case, we have a <code>Foo&lt;Double&gt;</code> which is converted into a</p><p><code>Foo&lt;String&gt;</code> using our new map function.</p><p>However there are instances where this can cause issues.</p><h3>Arrays of Arrays</h3><p>The simplest case where map doesn't quite do what you want would be when you need a flat list. For instance, let's say you want to get a flat list of books from their authors:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> Author {
  ...
  <span class="keyword">let</span> name : <span class="type">String</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> books : [<span class="type">String</span>]
}
</code></pre><p>Then you have a list of authors and their books in JSON:</p><pre><code>[
  {
    <span class="string">"Franz Kafka"</span>: [
      <span class="string">"Stories"</span>,
      <span class="string">"The Trial"</span>,
      <span class="string">"The Castle"</span>
    ]
  },
  {
    <span class="string">"Fyodor Dostoevsky"</span>: [
      <span class="string">"Crime and Punishment"</span>,
      <span class="string">"The Idiot"</span>,
      <span class="string">"The Possessed"</span>,
      <span class="string">"The Brothers Karamazov"</span>
    ]
  },
  {
    <span class="string">"Leo Tolstoy"</span>: [
      <span class="string">"War and Peace"</span>,
      <span class="string">"Anna Karenina"</span>,
      <span class="string">"The Death of Ivan Ilyich"</span>
    ]
  },
  {
    <span class="string">"William Shakespeare"</span>: [
      <span class="string">"Hamlet"</span>,
      <span class="string">"King Lear"</span>,
      <span class="string">"Othello"</span>
    ]
  }
]
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, map would only return an <strong>Array of an Array</strong> or <strong>Jagged Array</strong> of books (i.e. <code>[[String]]</code>):</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> authors : [<span class="type">Author</span>] = ...
<span class="keyword">let</span> books : [[<span class="type">String</span>]] = authors.<span class="call">map</span> {
  $0.<span class="property">books</span>
}
</code></pre><p>As a result, we get:</p><pre><code>[
  [
    <span class="string">"Stories"</span>,
    <span class="string">"The Trial"</span>,
    <span class="string">"The Castle"</span>
  ],
  [
      <span class="string">"Crime and Punishment"</span>,
      <span class="string">"The Idiot"</span>,
      <span class="string">"The Possessed"</span>,
      <span class="string">"The Brothers Karamazov"</span>
   ],...
</code></pre><p>However, this is where a <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> would be useful:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> authors : [<span class="type">Author</span>] = ...
<span class="keyword">let</span> books : [<span class="type">String</span>] = authors.<span class="call">flatMap</span> {
  $0.<span class="property">books</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Now, rather than returning an Array of Arrays, <em>flatMap</em> automatically flattens the result. Not only does this work with Arrays but other <strong>Generics</strong> as well. A great example of this is in use with asynchronous methods.</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about how SwiftNIO and Google Futures does this with Promises and Futures, check out my <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/asynchronous-multi-threaded-parallel-world-of-swift/">article on asynchronous programming here.</a> Additionally Combine, which is frequently used with SwiftUI, contains a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204718-map">map</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204712-flatmap">flatMap</a> for its Publishers as well.</p><p>Besides Arrays, Promises, and Combine Publishers, there was one other Generic we are forgetting to cover which often can cause issues. If you have run into the elusive <code>Type??</code> value then you have probably run into an instance where <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> should be used on <strong>Optionals</strong>.</p><h2>flatMap and the elusive Double Optional??</h2><p>So let's say we have a generic function which returns an optional:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> maybe&lt;T&gt;(<span class="keyword">_</span> value: <span class="type">T</span>) -&gt; <span class="type">T</span>? {
  <span class="type">Bool</span>.<span class="call">random</span>() ? value : <span class="keyword">nil</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Then you've created a optional value:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> optionalValue : <span class="type">Int</span>? = <span class="type">Int</span>.<span class="call">random</span>(in: <span class="number">0</span>...<span class="number">10</span>)
</code></pre><p>Next, you decide to call that function which returns an optional on the option value and you end up with something that makes very little sense:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> optionalOptional : <span class="type">Int</span>?? = <span class="call">maybe</span>(optionalValue)
</code></pre><p>What is an <code>Int??</code>...?</p><p>As stated earlier <strong>an Optional is really another Generic type.</strong> Here's a small snippet of the Generic Enumeration behind the scenes:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">public enum</span> Optional&lt;Wrapped&gt; {
    <span class="keyword">case</span> none
    <span class="keyword">case</span> some(<span class="type">Wrapped</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>As you can see the '?' is simply syntactic sugar. So for instance an</p><p><code>Int?</code> is really an <code>Optional&lt;Int&gt;</code>. Therefore, we can surmise that an</p><p><code>Int??</code> is really a <code>Optional&lt;Optional&lt;Int&gt;&gt;</code>.</p><p>Therefore, we need to make sure that our result is flattened in order to use it. Luckily, <strong>Optional</strong> provides a <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> function as well. For this reason, we can use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/optional/1540500-flatmap"><code>Optional.flatMap</code></a> to fix our result:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> betterOptionalValue : <span class="type">Int</span>? = optionalValue.<span class="call">flatMap</span>(<span class="call">maybe</span>(<span class="keyword">_</span>:))
</code></pre><p>By using <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong>, it flattens the result to return a <em>single</em> <strong>Optional</strong>. It's important to note, that <code>optionalValue</code> does not contain the <code>?</code> suffix since we want to call <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> on</p><p><code>Optional&lt;Int&gt;</code> as opposed to Int. Likewise, <strong>Optional</strong> also contains a map function for when your method will return a non-optional value and does not require flattening.</p><h3>flatMap, parsing, and conversion</h3><p>There are a few use cases where <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> on an <strong>Optional</strong> are useful. For instance, when you are parsing a value, there are cases where you wish to throw an error depending whether the value is invalid or missing (i.e. <code>nil</code>). However in some instances, you don't care whether the value is invalid or <code>nil</code> and want to just return <code>nil</code> if it fails. In this case, <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> fits perfectly well:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> parse (<span class="keyword">_</span> rawValue : <span class="type">RawType</span>) -&gt; <span class="type">ParsedType</span>?

<span class="keyword">let</span> parsedValue = optionalRawValue.<span class="call">flatMap</span>(parse)
</code></pre><p>For instance, parsing UUID from a String, rather than:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> uuid : <span class="type">UUID</span>?

<span class="keyword">if let</span> uuidString = dictionary[<span class="string">"VCS_UUID"</span>] {
  uuid = <span class="type">UUID</span>(uuidString: uuidString)
} <span class="keyword">else</span> {
  uuid = <span class="keyword">nil</span>
}
</code></pre><p>... we can use:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> uuid = dictionary[<span class="string">"VCS_UUID"</span>].<span class="call">flatMap</span>(<span class="type">UUID</span>.<span class="keyword">init</span>(uuidString:))
</code></pre><p>Besides parsing, I've used <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> in instances where I need to convert a successful <code>Result</code> or value to a SwiftUI <code>View</code> as well:</p><pre><code>   <span class="keyword">var</span> iconImage: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> {
    <span class="keyword">return self</span>.<span class="property">icon</span>.<span class="call">flatMap</span> { icon <span class="keyword">in
      guard case let</span> .<span class="call">image</span>(name) = icon <span class="keyword">else</span> {
        <span class="keyword">return nil</span>
      }
      <span class="keyword">return</span> name
    }.<span class="call">map</span> {
      <span class="type">Image</span>($0).<span class="call">renderingMode</span>(.<span class="dotAccess">template</span>)
    }
  }
</code></pre><p>In this case if the <code>self</code> <code>View</code> contains an <code>icon</code> with the case</p><p><code>image</code> then use the <code>name</code> and create templated <code>Image</code> for the <code>View</code>.</p><p>While there are instances where <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> is useful, more often than not you may just wish to filter the <strong>Optional</strong> results from a map operation. This is where <strong><em>compactMap</em></strong> comes in.</p><h2>flatMap vs compactMap</h2><p>In many instances, you probably want simply remove Optionals from your Array or having a map return only non-Optional values. Before Swift 4.1, there was only one method for doing this as well as the traditional <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> mentioned previously. Unfortunately as stated in <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0187-introduce-filtermap.md">the implemented proposal,</a> this caused much confusion. Therefore <strong><em>compactMap</em></strong> was added in Swift 4.1.</p><p>While <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> concerns the returning of a flat Array of values, <strong><em>compactMap</em></strong> is specifically for instances where you need to make sure the Array returned contains no Optional values. In effect, <strong>if the closure for each item can return multiple items then a flatMap is right; otherwise if the closure can return either no items (i.e. nil) or one then compactMap makes the most sense.</strong></p><p>So for example, if we have <code>Node</code> struct and an Array of optional Nodes:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> Node&lt;Value&gt; {
  <span class="keyword">let</span> value : <span class="type">Value</span>
  <span class="keyword">let</span> children : [<span class="type">Node</span>&lt;<span class="type">Value</span>&gt;]
}

<span class="keyword">let</span> items : [<span class="type">Node</span>&lt;<span class="type">Int</span>&gt;?]
</code></pre><p>Therefore, let's see what happens when we use a combination of <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> and <strong><em>compactMap</em></strong> in various ways:</p><pre><code><span class="comment">// returns an array with no Optionals</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> array : [<span class="type">Node</span>&lt;<span class="type">Int</span>&gt;] = items.<span class="property">compactMap</span>{ $0 }

<span class="comment">// returns and array of array of Nodes</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> arrayArray : [[<span class="type">Node</span>&lt;<span class="type">Int</span>&gt;]] = items.<span class="property">compactMap</span>{ $0?.<span class="property">children</span> }

<span class="comment">// assumes same as previous compactMap and issues a warning</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> arrayArrayWithWarning : [[<span class="type">Node</span>&lt;<span class="type">Int</span>&gt;]] = items.<span class="property">flatMap</span>{ $0?.<span class="property">children</span> }

<span class="comment">// returns flat array of Nodes from children</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> flatArray = items.<span class="property">flatMap</span>{ $0?.<span class="property">children</span> ?? [<span class="type">Node</span>]() }

<span class="comment">// returns flat array of Nodes from children as well</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> flatCompactArray = items.<span class="property">compactMap</span>{ $0 }.flatMap{ $0.<span class="property">children</span> }
</code></pre><p>Most importantly, <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> is not supposed to return a <code>nil</code> (otherwise the compiler assumes it's <strong><em>compactMap</em></strong> and issues a warning). Therefore, you can either use <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html#ID72">the nil-coalesce operator</a> to return an empty Array or use <strong><em>compactMap</em></strong> beforehand to ensure there will never be <code>nil</code>.</p><h2>flatMap and flattening the Optionals and Generics</h2><p>In this article, you've learned a few key points with regards to <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> and its relationship to <strong>Generics</strong> and specifically <strong>Optionals</strong>:</p><ul><li>The term <strong><em>flatten</em></strong> in functional programming means to remove a secondary generic into a one-dimensional result such as returning a <code>Value?</code> rather than <code>Value??</code> or <code>[Value]</code> rather than [<code>[Value]]</code></li><li><strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> is to be used when you have an Array of Arrays and wish to flatten those Collections into a simple one-dimensional Array</li><li>Use <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> when you are returning a result of the same <strong>Generic</strong> type as opposed to map when you are just returning a value such as a <strong>Promise</strong>, <strong>Future</strong>, or <strong>Combine</strong> <strong>Publisher</strong></li><li><strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> is important for <strong>Optionals</strong> in removing **Double Optionals** (i.e. <code>Type??</code>) from your code</li><li><strong>flatMap</strong> is also useful for <strong>Optional</strong> when you are mapping an <strong>Optional</strong> value and **don't need to distinguish between a nil or invalid input value**</li><li><strong><em>compactMap</em></strong> is specifically for the removing nil results from an one-dimensional array</li><li>If a <strong><em>flatMap</em></strong> closure can return nil, return an empty Array instead</li></ul><p>Feel free to reach out if you have any additional questions <a href="https://twitter.com/leogdion">on Twitter <strong>@leogdion</strong></a> or signup for the newsletter below to get the latest tutorials and guides on Swift development.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/ios-software-architecture</guid><title>ios-software-architecture</title><description>"You\u2019ve started out with an idea to build an iOS app and you need to choose its software architecture.

Also how the app will meet that need and what it will look like. It's at this point you should think about iOS software architecture.<br> <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/amelie-mourichon-hcLSA1MiU3A-unsplash-1024x768.jpg"/>{.wp-image-2043 width="1024" height="768"}</p><p>Software architecture is the term we use to describe how major components of an app work together. The structure and design of modern software are usually too complex to consider. Therefore, we use the term 'architecture' as an abstraction. In practice, 'software architecture' means "the parts of the app we need to get right."</p><p>The reason well-planned architecture for your app is critical is that by investing time in planning, it pays off over time. In the end, you create a shared understanding between you and your developers. This includes how they structure and design the app. As a result, you are saving you time and money.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQpRYibmyvQ&amp;feature=youtu.be :::</p><p>In this post, I cover three essential concepts for good iOS software architecture:</p><ul><li>Patterns &amp; Practices</li><li>Code Modularization</li><li>Code Quality</li></ul><p>I'll be explaining a bit about each, how you can put them in place for your app.</p><h2>iOS Software Architecture Patterns</h2><p>Choosing a certain architecture for your iOS app determines the design of different aspects of your software. Within that, it also determines what kind of design patterns you will want to use. A Pattern in the context of software is a common response to a recurring problem. It uses a common language to outline the elements needed to solve a software challenge.</p><p>Patterns are particularly useful when working with a large team of developers. They can make your developers substantially more efficient by using a refined approach to solving problems. Patterns ensure changes to the code are consistent and reduce risk for major changes.</p><p>Good use of Architecture Patterns makes it easy for developers to understand the software. In the end that makes it easy to change it. This means new features can be delivered faster, with fewer bugs, and therefore easier fixes.</p><p>There are a few architectural patterns that are very useful when making iOS apps:</p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EAS.42-Slides.001-scaled.jpeg?fit=640%2C360&ssl=1"/><p>{.wp-image-2045}</p><h3>Delegation and MVC with iOS Software Architecture</h3><p>Delegation is a pattern we use in iOS user interface (UI) development for displaying tables of information in an app. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern uses Delegation. Additionally, MVC is the most popular iOS Software architectural pattern for developing Apple apps. This is how it works:</p><ul><li>A user performs an action within the user interface (ie <strong>View</strong>).</li><li>View passes it to the <strong>Controller</strong> to deal with.</li><li>The Controller makes decisions about what to do with the action it's been given. If needed, it makes changes to the state of the <strong>Model</strong>, which will change its data values in response.</li><li>The Controller then sees these new values and sets them for View.</li></ul><p>Delegation allows you to control how the Controller provides both the data and the way that data needs to be displayed to View in the final step. This makes it easy to break apart the functionality of the code to display table information to your user the way you want.</p><h3>Protocol-Oriented Programming</h3><p>This is fundamental to developing any app written in Swift (ie all native apps for iOS). Protocols allow you to group together and separate functionality. Additionally it shows how data and their objects work together.</p><p>Protocols are useful tools for creating functionality for your app. Instead of building a whole new object (which you might with other kinds of architecture), you add different protocols until your objects can do what you want. Protocol-oriented programming means using an architecture where you design your app around protocols. This makes it easy to test the different parts of your app and <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/01/06/avoid-ios-app-failure-with-tdd/">use Test-Driven Development</a>.</p><h3>Functional Programming</h3><p>Functional programming is the idea of having your app work based around information supplied to it and rules it must follow. What this means is you want the app to react to what your user is doing. In contrast other kinds of programming styles, such as Imperative which follow a set of instructions, this can be a challenge. For instance, if there are multiple data sources and multiple views. The result is an app that can adapt to your user's behavior, which is always a desirable trait in a well-designed app.</p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/EAS.42-Slides.002-1-scaled.jpeg?fit=640%2C360&ssl=1"/><p>{.wp-image-2047}</p><h3>Reactive Programming in iOS Software Architecture</h3><p>This pattern has become popular with the introduction of <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/02/04/swiftui-everything-is-possible-if-you-think-like-apple/">SwiftUI</a>, which encourages developers to use functional reactive programming. For this reason, Apple introduced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine">the Combine framework</a> and the Subscriber-Publisher model. Specifically, this allows you to sort and filter values into your UI. Additionally, it's also used with Model-View-ViewModel, which removes the Controller in the MVC pattern mentioned above. With Model-View-Model, the Controller is replaced with a ViewModel. Conversely, the ViewModel automates how the Model can be rendered directly into the View by making changes to the Model data and reacting accordingly. This is useful for iOS apps that need to use a resource library that isn't written in Swift. It allows you to bridge from another programming language into Swift.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":71581,"title":"WWDC 2019 - SwiftUI with Jason

As a result, this makes it easier to both test and reuse pieces of code in different parts of your app. Additionally, makes it easy to use the same piece of code for different platforms, so your iOS code could work on macOS too.</p><p>There are three ways I recommend for creating modularity in iOS app development:</p><h3>Framework Targets</h3><p>In Xcode (the development environment for macOS), Framework Targets are a way to easily move your app's code from the testing environment where it was built to the production environment your users can see. Ordinarily, you have to swap out all the URLs and APIs from the testing version of your app to the production one. With Framework Targets, this is done automatically.</p><h3>Projects and Workspaces</h3><p>You have a specific piece of code that doesn't fit into an existing framework but might be used in many apps. A way to deal with this is to have more than one project and workspace. This allows you to organize pieces of code like this and show how they are related to different development projects.</p><h3>Swift Packages</h3><p>The newest and simplest way to achieve modularity. Although limited to Swift and not compatible with older apps, Apple is encouraging a shift toward using only Swift for new apps. As a result, this means Packages will likely become the default to create modularity for iOS apps.

If you have high-quality code, it will make development faster, easier, and cheaper.</p><p>There are a few are great ways to ensure high-quality code:</p><h3>Test-Driven Development</h3><p><a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/01/06/avoid-ios-app-failure-with-tdd/">I recently did a piece about Test-Driven Development (TDD), which you can find here</a>. Committing to doing good testing and setting up a good testing environment is one of the most powerful things you can do to make your code top-notch.</p><h3>Ensure Good Code Coverage</h3><p>Code coverage, measured as a percentage, refers to how much of your app's code is executed during testing. A high degree of code coverage indicates a low number of possible undetected bugs in your app. This is a great measurement for determining code quality, although you shouldn't be too strict about it. While it's obviously great if you reach 100% coverage, it might come at a cost when there are more important things you could be doing to serve your users.</p><h3>Complexity</h3><p>In software development, there are two kinds of complexity we want to observe and measure:</p><p><strong>Cyclomatic Complexity</strong> -- this metric looks at the number of linear paths it is possible for data to take through your app's source code. While there are going to be times when it's necessary to have many paths, you generally want to limit this kind of complexity. The reason is that more paths mean needing more test cases to make sure they all work, and more paths mean more opportunities for bugs.</p><p><strong>Cognitive Complexity</strong> -- this metric simply refers to how easy it is for people to understand your code. Easy-to-understand code is always going to be easier to maintain. This is especially true if the person who wrote the code and the person maintaining it are different people.</p><p>Overall, keeping your complexity low by limiting file and function length means adding features and fixing bugs takes less effort.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":199010,"title":"Managing Code Quality with Anne

While simple to do, this often gets missed because it takes time to sit down and review code someone else has written ---time you might feel you don't have. Having someone review what you've written is a great way of spotting mistakes and ensuring better-quality code.</p><h3>Continuous Integration</h3><p>This is something <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/03/02/ios-continuous-integration-avoid-merge-hell/">I've written about recently, explaining what Continuous Integration (CI) is and why it's important.</a> If you are able to deploy the code frequently, it means you can deliver features more rapidly. Additionally, if there are problems or bugs, you will discover them faster and will be easier to fix. Therefore, using CI is a great way to shorten the time it takes to get feedback from your users.</p><h2>The Components of Good iOS Software Architecture</h2><p>By thoughtfully choosing an architecture for your app, using effective patterns and modularity, as well following good code quality practices, you will find:</p><ul><li>bug fixes become easier;</li><li>adding new features becomes straightforward;</li><li>your app becomes easier to test and maintain; and,</li><li>your developers will have an easier time understanding the code.</li></ul><p>I believe these are things we should all try to observe. You'll find it not only improves the morale of your developers, but it will also save you a lot of time and money in the long term.<br></p><h2>Want more about iOS software architecture on how to create better iOS apps?</h2><p>If you want to learn ways to save time and money and make smart decisions about developing an iOS app for your business, I invite you to <a href="https://brightdigit.com/subscribe/">sign up for my newsletter</a>. I will let you know when I put out new content like this and if there are important things you should know.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/ios-continuous-integration-avoid-merge-hell</guid><title>ios-continuous-integration-avoid-merge-hell</title><description>Continuous integration is the practice where small code changes are tested to ensure nothing breaks.

It makes building and deploying an app easy.</p><p>The practice is a response to teams of developers making big changes to the code. Often times, teams are working on the code without testing it. As a result, this breaks lots of functionality, making development slow and painful.</p><p>This post is a brief introduction to Continuous Integration and how that works when building apps for iOS. I will also cover how you and your team can get started. Additionally, this includes building or maintaining your iOS app cheaper and faster.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-group} ::: {.wp-block-group__inner-container}</p><hr><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app

For instance, CI helps avoid that painful moment after everyone has written changes or fixes to your app. As a result, everything needs to b integrated back into the code. In particular, this is known as a <strong><em>merge</em></strong>. Eventually, you discover there are now bugs, errors and conflicts created between the different changes.</p><p>As you might imagine, it is messy and unpleasant to untangle the code causing problems and fix them. For developers, this is known as <strong><em>merge hell</em></strong>. For a business that needs the app, it makes any changes very expensive, both in money and time.</p><p><strong>CI avoids this problem by requiring developers to write, test, and merge lines of code as rapidly as possible.</strong> The original proponents of CI suggested developers merge their code at least once a week. However, daily integration is the most common practice, with some companies, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/how-we-build-code-at-netflix-c5d9bd727f15">like Netflix, integrating many times a day</a>. The result is that changes happen quickly and if any problems are found, they are small and easy to fix.</p><p>There are also a number of additional benefits that CI can bring:</p><h3><strong>Reduce over-reliance on specific tools, services or individuals</strong></h3><p>Because CI forces you to make sure everything works constantly on a single source of code, it will quickly expose any ways that prevent you from doing this. This ensures that your app will run on your customers' machines. As a result. this prevents issues where things will only work with specific tools.</p><h3><strong>If it can be automated, it will be automated</strong></h3><p>Core to practicing CI is being able to fully automate all the tests needed to ensure a piece of code will work and automate the deployment process itself. It isn't possible to merge code on a daily basis without this level of automation. The results should be your developers spending as little time as possible testing and merging their code.</p><h3><strong>Faster feedback</strong></h3><p>By integrating code often, you get feedback in the smallest amount of time possible. As a result, this allows you to quickly discover if something works or not.</p><h3><strong>Helps improve your business</strong></h3><p>The above doesn't just apply to writing code; it also allows you to rapidly test how your app works on a business-use level:</p><ul><li>Do your customers like a new feature or not?</li><li>Are they having any difficulties purchasing your products?</li><li>Are they using the app in any unexpected ways?</li></ul><p>CI can help you answer these questions quickly and help you create a better experience for them.</p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ci-appstore-iphone-1.png?fit=640%2C360&ssl=1"/><p>{.wp-image-1966}</p><h2>Continuous Integration &amp; iOS</h2><p>Practicing with CI when building iOS apps is the same as with any other platform, but Apple does make things a little more difficult. These are relatively easy to overcome but are worth identifying.</p><p>The primary obstacle to practicing CI is Apple's review process. For instance, if you want to deploy code multiple times a day. With Apple's review process, it ends up being difficult to get your app into the App Store that often. However, if the code change is in a test phase as opposed to production, the review times can be negligible. That is to say, if you use a service like Apple's TestFlight, then the deploy meant can be immediate.</p><p>Often, when you have conflicts in an iOS app, they are small but important. For example, you can forget to update a build number (easily forgettable), or not have the right certificates or profiles set up.</p><p>Ultimately, Apple simply requires you to deploy apps in a very specific way. Some of it can be automated, but some can't. This will mean you may need more time than developing apps for other platforms.</p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/people-doing-marathon-618612.jpg?fit=640%2C427&ssl=1"/><p>{.wp-image-1968}</p><h2>How to get started using Continuous Integration</h2><p>One of the best parts of CI is that it is straightforward to get started with it. You only really need a few things to get started:</p><h3>Make Sure Your Developers Have All The Same Things</h3><p>What I mean here is if one developer has a tool or something that is needed to build and test code for your app, ALL the developers should have it. Part of being able to practice CI is being able to reproduce everything your app does on any of your machines. Otherwise, it produces a dependency and will slow everything down.</p><h3>One Source Of Code Only</h3><p>In order for CI to work, developers must be working off a single source of code for your app, known as a repository. All code merges are made to this single source. This avoids any confusion and ensures any changes made are only to the most version of your app.</p><h3>Fully Automate Your Tests</h3><p>This is absolutely essential for CI. That is to say, an automated testing environment can run thousands of tests in a matter of minutes. (In contrast, it would take hours or days for a human to do manually). As a result of automating your environment, you quickly find out if there are any problems with any change. A point often overlooked but if you don't have this already, it may take some effort to set up. However, it will easily pay for itself in the time and money it will save you.</p><p>There are some excellent services available to help you automate all your testing in the cloud. Some of the most popular ones are <a href="https://www.bitrise.io/">BitRise</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a>, and <a href="https://circleci.com/">Circle CI</a>. Additionally, there's <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">Fastlane</a>, a software tool for automating the iOS deployment process.</p><h3>Get A Code Review Process</h3><p>Along with developing a process for all your testing, there should be a process for ensuring code has been reviewed before it is merged. This ensures that someone is checking for mistakes and also giving feedback to the developers. It is a simple way of catching problems early so you don't have to deal with them later. Online services like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> have mechanisms for this built in, known as a pull request process, which requires someone to approve any changes a developer has submitted.</p><h3>Know Who's Responsible</h3><p>Related to the above, you often won't want everyone involved to have the same level of authority or access -- you shouldn't have a developer that can make changes without anyone else having to approve them. This is less about the technology involved and more about the people. Who is responsible for what, and if a mistake is made, who finds out and delivers the feedback necessary to fix it? Ideally, you should figure out everyone's roles and responsibilities before you start.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-group} ::: {.wp-block-group__inner-container}</p><hr><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app

If you wish to create your own package, it's important to make sure your code works where it's supposed to and the quality is good. Most importantly, continuous integration is a great way to ensure that. If you are interested in learning why continuous integration is important, <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2020/03/02/ios-continuous-integration-avoid-merge-hell/">check out this article on avoiding <em>merge hell</em></a>. Therefore, in this article I am going to show you how to setup Swift package continuous integration.</p><p>Specifically, I am going to break down the following:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#getting-started">Basics of Creating a Package</a></strong></li><li><a href="#specifying-platforms-devices"><strong>Designating Platforms and Operating Systems</strong></a></li><li><a href="#continuous-integration"><strong>Setting Up Travis-CI and GitHub Actions</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href="#linux-ci">Adding Linux Support</a></strong></li><li><a href="#testing"><strong>Testing and Code Coverage</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href="#code-quality">Linting, Formatting, and Code Quality</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#documentation">Automating Code Documentation</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#distrbuting">Distributing and Sharing</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#examples-integration">Samples and Examples</a></strong></li></ul><p>What's important to realize is that Swift packages are reusable pieces of code which encapsulate a set of functionality. In the end, there are two ways to create a Swift package: via <em>Xcode</em> or command line.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>Under the Xcode menu, go to <code>File &gt; New &gt; Swift Package</code> and follow the corresponding dialog. Alternatively, you can use the swift command line tool to create your package. First, create an empty directory and run the create package subcommand:</p><pre><code>&gt; mkdir <span class="type">New</span>-<span class="type">Package</span>
&gt; swift package <span class="keyword">init</span>
</code></pre><p>In the end, you should have:</p><ul><li>A <em>Source</em> directory for your main source code</li><li>A <em>Tests</em> directory for your testing code</li><li>A <em>Package.swift</em> containing the configuration in Swift of your code</li></ul><h2>Specifying Platforms and Devices {#specifying-platforms-devices}</h2><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/platforms-and-devices.png"/><p>{.wp-image-871 width="1864" height="878"}</p><p>Before distributing your Swift package, it's important to note which operating systems or platforms your code can run on. In the past I've reasonably assumed a Swift package would work on watchOS or Linux for instance. Only after adding the dependency and attempting to compile, did I realize the incompatibility issue. If you use an API that is limited to certain platforms, you have two options.</p><h3>Specify via Package</h3><p>Firstly, you can specify an operating system and version in the</p><p><code>Package.swift</code> under the <code>platforms</code> property:</p><pre><code>...
  platforms: [
        .<span class="call">macOS</span>(.<span class="dotAccess">v10_15</span>),
        .<span class="call">iOS</span>(.<span class="dotAccess">v13</span>),
        .<span class="call">watchOS</span>(.<span class="dotAccess">v5</span>),
        .<span class="call">tvOS</span>(.<span class="dotAccess">v13</span>)
    ]
...
</code></pre><h3>Using Attributes and API Availability</h3><p>On the other hand, you may want to offer some functionality on some devices. With this in mind, you can use the attributes and API availability checks. In other words the <code>available</code> attribute allows you to mark certain functionality of your Swift package unavailable on certain operating systems and versions.</p><p>In addition, by doing API availability checks you can supply the correct implementation based on operating system and version. Furthermore, whenever you may need to import certain frameworks which may be required but may not be available, you can use <code>canImport</code>, as well.</p><p>Here's an example of extending <code>CGFloat</code> for all operating systems, but importing <code>CoreGraphics</code>, when possible:</p><pre><code><span class="preprocessing">#if canImport(CoreGraphics)</span>
  <span class="keyword">import</span> CoreGraphics
<span class="preprocessing">#endif</span>

<span class="keyword">extension</span> <span class="type">CGFloat</span> {
  <span class="keyword">var</span> clean: <span class="type">String</span> {
    <span class="call">truncatingRemainder</span>(dividingBy: <span class="number">1</span>) == <span class="number">0</span> ? <span class="type">String</span>(format: <span class="string">"%.0f"</span>, <span class="keyword">self</span>) : description
  }
}
</code></pre><hr><p>Be that as it may, if you are planning on supporting all operating systems which support Swift then there is no need to do this. Regardless, it may be worth spending some time verifying and updating this property accordingly.</p><h2>Why Continuous Integration? {#continuous-integration}</h2><p>Having properly setup your package and provided correct compatibility, it's important to make sure your package works. Additionally, you may want to make sure each change to your code works correctly. Luckily, this is where Continuous Integration comes in.</p><p>Continuous integration (CI) is the software practice where small code changes are frequently tested with the rest of the code to ensure nothing breaks as it changes. In other words, with CI we can make sure each change works correctly by integrating a service with our code.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":108177,"title":"Continuous Integration

Often times, we may be have some source, artifact, or tool required to build our code. However with a cloud service, you can ensure that if your Swift package builds and tests in the cloud it will work for anyone else.</p><p>Luckily, there are some great services out there to help your Swift package especially if it's a public GitHub repository. At the present time, unfortunately, some services <strong>only</strong> support Continuous Integration for iOS Applications rather than Swift packages such as <strong><a href="https://circleci.com">Circle CI</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.bitrise.io">Bitrise</a></strong>. Be that as it may, <strong><a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis-CI</a></strong> as well as the most recent <strong><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a></strong> allow for Swift Package Continuous Integration.<img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/TravisCI-Full-Color-2.png"/>{.alignnone .size-full .wp-image-841 width="642" height="201"}</p><h3>Travis-CI</h3><p><strong><a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis-CI</a></strong> is one of the older Continuous Integration services out there. Most importantly for public repositories, <strong><a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis-CI</a></strong> is completely free. In other words, you can configure your Swift package on <strong><a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis-CI</a></strong>. In order to configure your repository, signup with <strong><a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis-CI</a></strong> by linking your GitHub account or organization. Next you need to setup your</p><p><code>.travis.yml</code> file.</p><p>Notably, there are three key components for setting up a Swift package in Travis-CI:</p><ul><li>Specifying the correct operating system and Xcode version</li><li>Building and testing your code</li></ul><p>For example, here is a simple <code>.travis.yml</code> file:</p><pre><code>language: objective-c
os: osx
osx_image: xcode11.<span class="number">3</span>
script:
  - swift build
  - swift test
</code></pre><p>The first three properties setup the virtual machine which <strong><a href="https://travis-ci.com">Travis-CI</a></strong> uses. Next, the lines under</p><p><code>script</code> specify the commands Travis-CI needs to run to verify the Swift package is working. In this case, <strong>since we are not building from an Xcode project or workspace, we need to specify our own <em>custom</em> commands.</strong> In other words, rather than using <em>xcodebuild</em>, the Swift command line tool will build and test our package.</p><p>While Travis-CI is the most experienced cloud CI service out there, recently GitHub has also offered its own service with <strong><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a></strong>.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/44036562-2.png"/>{.wp-image-840} :::</p><h3>Github Actions</h3><p>With the fairly recent release of <strong><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a></strong>, you can setup Swift package continuous integration right from your repo. Most importantly <strong><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a></strong> is completely free for public repositories. Therefore, let's breakdown the functionality of <strong><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a></strong>.</p><h4>GitHub Actions Components - Workflows, Actions, Jobs and more</h4><p>In order to setup our Swift package continuous integration in GitHub Actions, we need to understand the components. Similar to Travis-CI, GitHub uses YAML for its configuration. Specifically these YAML files are known as workflow files. For example, here is a sample with the name</p><p><code>macOS</code>:</p><pre><code>name: macOS

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: <span class="type">Build</span>
      run: swift build
    - name: <span class="type">Run</span> tests
      run: swift test
</code></pre><p>In contrast to Travis-CI, you can setup multiple of these files. Therefore as long as you store them in your repository under the</p><p><code>.github/workflow</code> folder, <strong><a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a></strong> will execute each of these workflow files on trigger.</p><p>Speaking of <em>trigger</em>, you can specify many triggers. However in the case of our Swift package, we will only be using the <code>push</code> trigger to activate this workflow.</p><p>Below the <code>on</code> trigger, we have setup one job under <code>jobs</code> called</p><p><code>build</code>. With in the <code>build</code> job, we have specified the runner type (i.e virtual environment) of <code>macOS-latest</code>. In other words, it will be using the latest version of macOS to run the series of steps.</p><pre><code>...
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: <span class="type">Build</span>
      run: swift build
    - name: <span class="type">Run</span> tests
      run: swift test
</code></pre><h5>GitHub Actions - Step By Step</h5><p>Below the runner type property are the series of steps specified. In this case, the first step with the single <code>uses</code> property checks out the code from the repository. While the following steps have a <code>name</code> label and a <code>run</code> command to execute: first building the Swift package (<code>swift build</code>) then running tests provided (<code>swift test</code>).</p><p>What's important to note is that each needs a custom command (via <code>run</code>) with a <code>name</code> or to use a prebuilt action from the GitHub repo such as</p><p><code>actions/checkout@v2</code> to pull the source code from the repository. Unfortunately many of the GitHub Actions provided on GitHub may not be compatible with macOS due to various requirements.</p><p>Luckily you should have Continuous Integration setup for your Swift package in both Travis-CI and GitHub Actions. However if you wish to support Linux with your Swift package, it is import to configure the Swift package continuous integration for a Linux environment as well.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/ubuntu_black-orange_hex.png"/>{.wp-image-839 width="379" height="86"} :::</p><h3>Linux Support for Swift Package Continuous Integration {#linux-ci}</h3><p>If you wish for your Swift package to be supported everywhere, it might be a good idea to support Linux. Therefore, it's important to have your Swift package Continuous integration to extend to Linux. Thankfully both Travis-CI and GitHub Action support Linux (i.e. Ubuntu) as well as the configuration of more than one environment per repository. First, let's understand how build matrices work in Travis-CI.</p><h4>Configuring Travis-CI for Linux</h4><p>With Travis-CI, we can use a build matrix to include more than one environment. In other words, Travis-CI will run each environment in the build matrix in parallel. Therefore, let's swap the top section specifying only macOS from above with a build matrix including both macOS and Linux (i.e. Ubuntu 18.04-bionic):</p><pre><code>jobs:
  include:
    - os: linux
      dist: bionic
      sudo: <span class="keyword">required</span>
    - os: osx
      osx_image: xcode11.<span class="number">3</span>
</code></pre><p>Now, it will run each phase in parallel on Ubuntu as well as macOS. However we'll need to make changes to both of the these sections in order to support Linux. Most importantly, we will need to install Swift.</p><p>Therefore, we will move or create the <code>script</code> and <code>before_install</code> phases into separate bash scripts and update <code>.travis.yml</code> accordingly:</p><pre><code>jobs:
  include:
    - os: linux
      dist: bionic
      sudo: <span class="keyword">required</span>
    - os: osx
      osx_image: xcode11.<span class="number">3</span>
before_install:
  - ./<span class="type">Scripts</span>/before_install.<span class="property">sh</span>
script:
  - ./<span class="type">Scripts</span>/script.<span class="property">sh</span>
</code></pre><p>Next let's create a script for <code>before_install</code> named</p><p><code>before_install.sh</code> under the <code>Scripts</code> folder with the following code:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

<span class="keyword">if</span> [[ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME = 'osx' ]]; then
  # install macOS prerequistes
elif [[ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME = 'linux' ]]; then
  # download swift
  wget https://swift.<span class="property">org</span>/builds/swift-<span class="number">5.2</span>-release/ubuntu1804/swift-<span class="number">5.2</span>-<span class="type">RELEASE</span>/swift-<span class="number">5.2</span>-<span class="type">RELEASE</span>-ubuntu18.<span class="number">04</span>.<span class="property">tar</span>.<span class="property">gz</span>
  # extract the archive
  tar xzf swift-<span class="number">5.2</span>-<span class="type">RELEASE</span>-ubuntu18.<span class="number">04</span>.<span class="property">tar</span>.<span class="property">gz</span>
  # include the swift command <span class="keyword">in</span> the <span class="type">PATH</span>
  export <span class="type">PATH</span>=<span class="string">"${PWD}/swift-5.2-RELEASE-ubuntu18.04/usr/bin:$PATH"</span>
fi
</code></pre><p>Within the bash script, we check the environment variable</p><p><code>TRAVIS_OS_NAME</code> setup by Travis-CI. With the variable, we check whether it is <code>osx</code> for a macOS environment or <code>linux</code> for the Ubuntu environment.</p><p>Since Xcode is not available on Ubuntu, we need to manually within the bash script, download and extract Swift. Lastly we need to include the directory path of the Swift command tool within the environment <code>PATH</code> variable.</p><p>Correspondingly we need to make sure the <code>PATH</code> is updated in the</p><p><code>Scripts/script.sh</code> file:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

<span class="keyword">if</span> [[ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME = 'osx' ]]; then
  # <span class="type">What</span> to <span class="keyword">do in</span> macOS
elif [[ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME = 'linux' ]]; then
  # <span class="type">What</span> to <span class="keyword">do in</span> <span class="type">Ubunutu</span>
  export <span class="type">PATH</span>=<span class="string">"${PWD}/swift-5.2-RELEASE-ubuntu18.04/usr/bin:$PATH"</span>
fi

swift build
swift test
</code></pre><p>Therefore the only major change within the <code>script</code> section of the Travis-CI configuration is including the path to the Swift command line tool.</p><p>As a result, each time a push is made to the repository, Travis-CI will run both a macOS and Ubuntu process. In effect, we have setup Swift package continuous integration for both operating systems in Travis-CI. Accordingly, let's do the same thing for GitHub Actions.</p><h4>Configuring GitHub Actions for Linux</h4><p>While Travis-CI requires us to check the operating system within the build script, GitHub Actions allows us to use separate workflow files for each operating system.</p><pre><code>name: ubuntu

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-<span class="number">18.04</span>

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: <span class="type">Download Swift</span> <span class="number">5.2</span>
      run: wget -q https://swift.<span class="property">org</span>/builds/swift-<span class="number">5.2</span>-release/ubuntu1804/swift-<span class="number">5.2</span>-<span class="type">RELEASE</span>/swift-<span class="number">5.2</span>-<span class="type">RELEASE</span>-ubuntu18.<span class="number">04</span>.<span class="property">tar</span>.<span class="property">gz</span>
    - name: <span class="type">Extract Swift</span> <span class="number">5.2</span>
      run: tar xzf swift-<span class="number">5.2</span>-<span class="type">RELEASE</span>-ubuntu18.<span class="number">04</span>.<span class="property">tar</span>.<span class="property">gz</span>
    - name: <span class="type">Add Path</span>
      run: echo <span class="string">"::add-path::$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/swift-5.2-RELEASE-ubuntu18.04/usr/bin"</span>
    - name: <span class="type">Build</span>
      run: swift build
    - name: <span class="type">Run</span> tests
      run: swift test
</code></pre><p>In this case, each command is stored within an individual step. As can be seen, the one custom part is the method we use to add the path using GitHub Actions logging commands and variables. With</p><p><code>echo "::add-path::$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/swift-5.2-RELEASE-ubuntu18.04/usr/bin"</code>, we update the <code>PATH</code> variable.</p><p>As a result, your Swift package continuous integration should support Linux via Travis-CI and GitHub Action. However, there are a few steps in order to support Linux when it comes to testing.</p><h2>Testing, CI, and Linux {#testing}</h2><img src="https://i1.wp.com/learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/linux-test-swift.png?fit=640%2C316&ssl=1"/><p>{.wp-image-875}</p><p>When it comes to verifying whether your package works correctly, having the right unit tests are a major component of that. Luckily, if you are using the XCTest framework and setup the CI scaffold previously described, you should be good to go. However with Linux, XCTest will not automatically provide all the correct tests in your application without some modifications. There are a few ways of doing this:</p><ol><li>Manually update your XCTestManifests.swift and LinuxMain.swift :(</li><li>Run <code>swift test --generate-linuxmain</code> **before commit on your macOS machine** to let the swift command line tool update your LinuxMain.swift.</li><li><strong>Update your CI for Linux</strong> to run <code>swift test --enable-test-discovery</code> which will automatically discover and run your tests.</li></ol><p>If you are interested in learning more about this check out Ole Begemann's piece on <a href="https://oleb.net/blog/2017/03/keeping-xctest-in-sync/">keeping XCTest in sync</a> as well as <a href="https://oleb.net/2020/swift-test-discovery/">how automatic test discovery works</a>.</p><p>Now that we have our unit tests working correctly, let's look into keeping tracking of code coverage.</p><h3>Integrating Code Coverage</h3><p>Code coverage is a good way to keep track of how well your unit tests are handling. Luckily there are some great services out there to keep track of your code coverage as you build your Swift package.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/7c4f41a-pink.png"/>{.wp-image-838 width="150" height="150"} :::</p><h4>CodeCov</h4><p><strong><a href="http://codecov.io/">CodeCov.io</a></strong> is one such service which we can plugin into our Swift Package Continuous Integration setup. However, once you have signed up and added your public repository, it will take some configuration to make it work completely.</p><p>For instance, we must make sure that the tests, build a report, convert the report to a compatible format, then lastly upload the the report to <strong><a href="http://codecov.io/">CodeCov.io</a></strong>. Building the report when you run the unit tests is fairly easy. In this case, we simply need to add the flag <code>--enable-code-coverage</code> to our <code>swift test</code> for both Travis-CI and GitHub Actions; macOS and Linux:</p><pre><code>swift test --enable-code-coverage
</code></pre><p>Next, we need to prepare the report for upload using <code>llvm-cov</code>. With this in mind, on macOS you can use <code>xcrun</code> to run <code>llvm-cov</code>:</p><pre><code>xcrun llvm-cov export -format=<span class="string">"lcov"</span> .<span class="dotAccess">build</span>/debug/${{<span class="type">FRAMEWORK_NAME</span>}}<span class="type">PackageTests</span>.<span class="property">xctest</span>/<span class="type">Contents</span>/<span class="type">MacOS</span>/${{<span class="type">FRAMEWORK_NAME</span>}}<span class="type">PackageTests</span> -instr-profile .<span class="dotAccess">build</span>/debug/codecov/<span class="keyword">default</span>.<span class="property">profdata</span> &gt; info.<span class="property">lcov</span>
</code></pre><p>Corresponding in Linux, we can run <code>llvm-cov</code> manually:</p><pre><code>llvm-cov export -format=<span class="string">"lcov"</span> .<span class="dotAccess">build</span>/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/${{<span class="type">FRAMEWORK_NAME</span>}}<span class="type">PackageTests</span>.<span class="property">xctest</span> -instr-profile .<span class="dotAccess">build</span>/debug/codecov/<span class="keyword">default</span>.<span class="property">profdata</span> &gt; info.<span class="property">lcov</span>
</code></pre><p>Simply replace <code>${{FRAMEWORK_NAME}}</code> with your Swift package name or even better setup an environment variable in Travis-CI and GitHub Actions.</p><p>Lastly, we need to upload the report using the Bash script provided by CodeCov.io:</p><pre><code>bash &lt;(curl https://codecov.<span class="property">io</span>/bash)
</code></pre><p>While Travis-CI automatically integrates with CodeCov.io, GitHub does require <a href="https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-the-codecov-bash-uploader">manually setting up the token for CodeCov.io</a>:</p><ol><li>First, go to your project in CodeCov.io and copy the token from the project overview.</li><li>Go to your GitHub repository settings and under <em>Secrets</em> add the token under the name <code>CODECOV_TOKEN</code>.</li><li>Under both the macOS and ubuntu workflow files, add the <code>CODECOV_TOKEN</code> as the environment variable under the upload step.</li></ol><p>For example, here's the Ubuntu workflow file which uses an environment variable for the Swift package name and maps the <code>CODECOV_TOKEN</code> secret to the uploader command environment variable:</p><pre><code>...
    - name: <span class="type">Run</span> tests
      run: swift test --enable-code-coverage
    - name: <span class="type">Prepare Code Coverage</span>
      run: llvm-cov export -format=<span class="string">"lcov"</span> .<span class="dotAccess">build</span>/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/${{ env.<span class="type">PACKAGE_NAME</span> }}<span class="type">PackageTests</span>.<span class="property">xctest</span> -instr-profile .<span class="dotAccess">build</span>/debug/codecov/<span class="keyword">default</span>.<span class="property">profdata</span> &gt; info.<span class="property">lcov</span>
    - name: <span class="type">Upload</span> to <span class="type">CodeCov</span>.<span class="property">io</span>
      run: bash &lt;(curl https://codecov.<span class="property">io</span>/bash)
      env:
          <span class="type">CODECOV_TOKEN</span>: ${{ secrets.<span class="type">CODECOV_TOKEN</span> }}
</code></pre><p>Now that we have completed setting up a code coverage report with <strong>CodeCov.io</strong>, Let's talk about ensuring good code quality.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/medal-150x150.png"/>{.wp-image-837} :::</p><h2>Code Quality and CI {#code-quality}</h2><p>There are some great automated ways we can keep up code quality inside our Swift package continuous integration. However, nothing replaces a good code review. If you can, have some sort of code review process by someone else. If it's difficult to find someone else, I suggest reviewing a Swift package's code after some down time to ensure you can have a fresh look at your code.</p><p>Regardless, let's look at some of the ways we can automate code quality checks.</p><h3>Formatting, Beautification, and Linting</h3><p>There are two command line tools I use to maintain quality code while keeping formatting consistent: <strong><a href="https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat">SwiftFormat</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint">SwiftLint</a></strong>. Fortunately, each application can be installed via Homebrew. Therefore, we can use Homebrew bundle to automate the installation of both applications inside our Swift package continuous integration. With this in mind, add a file called <code>Brewfile</code> to the root of repository with the following text:</p><pre><code>brew <span class="string">"swiftformat"</span>
brew <span class="string">"swiftlint"</span>
</code></pre><p>Next we need to add the installation these applications in the earliest part of our CI setup. However these applications will only work on macOS and we need to verify that as well. Therefore we modify our</p><p><code>before_install.sh</code> script for Travis-CI with:</p><pre><code>...
<span class="keyword">if</span> [[ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME = 'osx' ]]; then
  brew update
  brew bundle
elif [[ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME = 'linux' ]]; then
...
</code></pre><p>Meanwhile, for Github Actions, we simply need to add steps to our macOS workflow file:</p><pre><code>...
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: <span class="type">Prepare Build</span>
      run: brew bundle
...
</code></pre><p>Lastly we need to add the following command to verify code quality after the installation:</p><pre><code>swiftformat --lint . &amp;&amp; swiftlint
</code></pre><p>In short, this command will run both applications in the CI process. Specifically we run <code>swiftformat</code> in linter mode, since our expectation is that the developer has already formatted the code correctly before commit. Correspondingly, with <code>swiftlint</code>, you can use the <code>autocorrect</code> subcommand to fix some linter errors in your code before commit.</p><p>Again, for Travis-CI, verify the <code>$TRAVIS_OS_NAME</code> is <code>osx</code>, so the CI doesn't run the tool in Linux.</p><p>Beside installation and execution of the tools within the Swift package continuous integration, you should probably add configuration files for both tools. In brief, these are <code>.swiftformat</code> and <code>.swiftlint.yml</code>. Futhermore, check out both the <strong><a href="https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat">SwiftFormat</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint">SwiftLint</a></strong> projects for details on how setup these configurations.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":199010,"title":"Managing Code Quality with Anne

Therefore, you may be interested in:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.codefactor.io/">CodeFactor.io</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://codebeat.co">CodeBeat</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://codeclimate.com">CodeClimate</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://houndci.com">HoundCI</a></strong></li></ul><p>After having setup these various tools, it's worth taking a look at some various issues which may crop up.</p><h3>Common Code Quality Issues</h3><p>Now that we have setup our Swift package continuous integration and plugged in several services, there are few issues you could resolve which will show up:</p><h4>Cyclomatic Complexity</h4><p><em>Cyclomatic Complexity</em> refers to the complexity of the code specifically when it comes to testability. In the end, if your code contains several logical paths, it is best to break these up. For instance, using <em>Protocol Oriented Programming</em>, you can have a protocol to test the case. Then, for each case use individual implementations and store them in an array. For instance, rather than:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">if</span> a == <span class="number">0</span> {
  <span class="keyword">if</span> b == <span class="number">0</span> {
  } ...
...
} <span class="keyword">else if</span> a == <span class="number">1</span> {
...
} <span class="keyword">else if</span> a == <span class="number">2</span>
...
}
</code></pre><p>Use a protocol which does:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">protocol</span> Doer {
  <span class="keyword">func</span> test (<span class="keyword">_</span> a: <span class="type">Int</span>, <span class="keyword">_</span> b: <span class="type">Int</span>) -&gt; <span class="type">Result</span>?
}

<span class="keyword">let</span> implementations : [<span class="type">Doer</span>] = [<span class="type">FooDoer</span>(), <span class="type">BarDoer</span>()]

<span class="keyword">var</span> result : <span class="type">Result</span>?

<span class="keyword">for</span> implementation <span class="keyword">in</span> implmentations <span class="keyword">while</span> result == <span class="keyword">nil</span> {
  result = <span class="call">implementation</span>(a, b)
}
</code></pre><p>As a result, testing and maintaining this code becomes much more simple.</p><h4>Cognitive Complexity</h4><p>While Cyclomatic Complexity determines how difficult your code will be to test, Cognitive Complexity is how difficult it is to read and understand. Therefore much of this involves breaks in logic, and unnecessary loop statements. However by making your code flow clearly from top to bottom this can be avoided.</p><h4>File and Function Too Long</h4><p>One of the easiest metrics of complexity is the length of your files and functions. In the end, simply refactoring should resolve the issue. To put it differently, break down large functions, classes, and structs into smaller components. At the same time, you may find a class which is difficult to split up such as a <code>UITableViewController</code>. In this case, Swift extensions are a great way to resolve this.</p><h4>Assignment Branch Condition</h4><p>Assignment Branch Condition typically is calculated based on the number of assignments, branches, and conditions as opposed to simply length. Therefore, this can be resolved by separating your functions into smaller pieces. In other words, reduce these complex elements from one function into several.</p><hr><p>Many of these code quality issues should be resolved, however it is good to not be overly concerned with some of these metrics. Similar to code coverage, it is much more a case-by-case need for resolution.</p><p>Additionally there can easily be instances of false positives such as <em>identical code</em> issues. In the end, it's important to have a measured but determined approach to code quality.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/book-2.png"/>{.wp-image-877} :::</p><h2>Documenting Your Swift Package {#documentation}</h2><p>If you intend to distribute your Swift package to the public then it's important to document your code and make that documentation easily available. In the first place, take a look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/">Apple's guidance on documenting Swift code</a> as well as:</p><ul><li><a href="https://sarunw.com/posts/swift-documentation/"><strong>Swift Documentation</strong> by Sarun Wongpatcharapakorn</a></li><li><a href="https://nshipster.com/swift-documentation/"><strong>Swift Documentation</strong> - NSHipster</a></li></ul><p>Once you've properly documented your Swift package API, let's add code documentation to our Swift package continuous integration.</p><p>Primarily, you have the option of using either <strong><a href="https://github.com/realm/jazzy">Jazzy by Realm</a></strong> or <a href="https://github.com/eneko/SourceDocs"><strong>SourceDocs</strong></a>. Each has their advantage depending on whether you wish to build a complete static HTML site. In that case, I would recommend <strong><a href="https://github.com/realm/jazzy">Jazzy</a></strong>. Especially considering the maturity of <strong><a href="https://github.com/realm/jazzy">Jazzy</a></strong>, it can be an excellent tool. On the other hand, if you wish to simply output Markdown for your package documentation, I'd recommend <a href="https://github.com/eneko/SourceDocs"><strong>SourceDocs</strong></a>.</p><h3>Using SourceDocs</h3><p>To build documentation using <code>sourcedocs</code>, first build your Swift package using <code>swift build</code>. Once your package is built, you run</p><p><code>sourcedocs</code> using:</p><pre><code>sourcedocs generate --spm-module <span class="type">PACKAGE_NAME</span>
</code></pre><p>Additionally, you can use a different output directory besides</p><p><code>Documentation</code>, such as <code>docs</code>. In order to do that, you can use the flag <code>--output-folder</code> like so:</p><pre><code>sourcedocs generate --spm-module <span class="type">PACKAGE_NAME</span> --output-folder docs
</code></pre><p>Furthermore, we can take the next step and integrate <code>sourcedocs</code> into our Swift package Continuous Integration.</p><h4>Adding SourceDocs to Swift Package Continuous Integration</h4><p>Similar to our other tools, we need to add <code>sourcedocs</code> to our Homebrew bundle file:</p><pre><code>brew <span class="string">"swiftformat"</span>
brew <span class="string">"swiftlint"</span>
brew <span class="string">"sourcedocs"</span>
</code></pre><p>Next in our macOS GitHub Action workflow file, we can add a step to build the documentation:</p><pre><code>     - name: <span class="type">Build Documentation</span>
      run: sourcedocs generate --spm-module ${{ env.<span class="type">PACKAGE_NAME</span> }} --output-folder docs
</code></pre><p>Lastly, in order to make sure our change is pushed, we need to add a step to commit and push any documentation changes:</p><pre><code>     - name: <span class="type">Commit</span> files
      run: |
        git config --local user.<span class="property">email</span> <span class="string">"action@github.com"</span>
        git config --local user.<span class="property">name</span> <span class="string">"GitHub Action"</span>
        git status
        git add [<span class="type">DOCUMENTATION DIRECTORY</span>]
        git diff-index --quiet <span class="type">HEAD</span> || git commit -m <span class="string">"[github action] Update Docs"</span>
        git push
</code></pre><p>A point often overlooked, is that this will fail if there is an already existing push committed while this CI takes place. Therefore, in those cases, the CI will fail. If you are concerned, I would recommend looking at using a pull request rather than a direct push to the branch.</p><p>After having built documentation for our swift package, it is important to make our package discoverable to others.</p><h2>Making Your Swift Package Available {#distrbuting}</h2><p>Now that we have setup:</p><ul><li>CI based on the supported platforms such as Linux</li><li>linting and code quality checks</li><li>code documentation</li></ul><p>... let's discuss how we can properly distribute the package to others.</p><h3>SwiftPM</h3><p>While Swift packages can easily be added simply as a few lines in a</p><p><code>Package.swift</code>, discoverability can be difficult. Luckily thanks to the work of Dave Verwer, the community has a great site with <strong><a href="http://swiftpm.co">swiftpm.co</a></strong>.</p><p>However there are some checks we should add to make sure your Swift package is valid. Additionally we can add these checks to the Swift package continuous integration.</p><h4>Using <code>jq</code> to Verify Products</h4><p>With this intention, we need to make sure that our swift package has at least one valid product. For instance, under the product section of my</p><p><code>Package.swift</code> for my package <strong><a href="https://github.com/brightdigit/AssetLib">AssetLib</a></strong>, it has a library product listed:</p><pre><code>...
  products: [
    <span class="comment">// Products define the executables and libraries produced by a package, and make them visible to other packages.</span>
    .<span class="call">library</span>(
      name: <span class="string">"AssetLib"</span>,
      targets: [<span class="string">"AssetLib"</span>]
    )
  ],
...
</code></pre><p>Fortunately, we can automate this by dumping the JSON of the package and verifying the products listed using <strong><a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a></strong>. <strong><a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a></strong> is a fantastic command-line tool for processing JSON data similar to <em>sed</em>. Therefore by piping the JSON from the swift subcommand <code>package dump-package</code> to <code>jq</code>, we can check the number products:</p><pre><code>swift package dump-package | jq -e <span class="string">".products | length &gt; 0"</span>
</code></pre><p>As can be seen, we are using the filter string to check the <code>length</code> property of the property <code>products</code> to see if there is more than one product.</p><p>Lastly, we can submit our Swift package for review by:</p><ul><li>Forking <strong><a href="https://github.com/daveverwer/SwiftPMLibrary">the Repo</a></strong></li><li>Adding our repos to <code>packages.json</code></li><li>Making sure <code>packages.json</code> is sorted via <code>jq</code> by running:<br> <code>echo "$(jq 'sort_by(ascii_downcase)' packages.json)" &gt; packages.json</code></li><li>Run <code>validate.sh</code></li><li>Create a pull request in GitHub</li></ul><p>Then wait for acceptance to see your package listed at <strong><a href="http://swiftpm.co">swiftpm.co</a></strong>.</p><h3>Cocoapods Compatibility</h3><p>While Swift packages are the future of dependency management, there are several reasons why <strong><a href="https://cocoapods.org">Cocoapods</a></strong> is still in use. For this reason, it's a good idea to add support for <strong><a href="https://cocoapods.org">Cocoapods</a></strong> to your library. Luckily, there are only a few simple steps to add for making our Swift package is compatible.</p><p>Once you have <strong><a href="https://cocoapods.org">Cocoapods</a></strong> installed, create the <strong><a href="https://cocoapods.org">Cocoapods</a></strong> spec by running:</p><pre><code>pod spec create $(git remote <span class="keyword">get</span>-url origin)
</code></pre><p>At the present time, you should have a <code>.podspec</code> file named after your library. Inside the <code>.podspec.</code> file, add or set:</p><ul><li>Long description under <code>spec.description</code></li><li>Short summary under <code>spec.summary</code></li><li><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-license-to-a-repository">Create License File</a> and set the set license type and file name under <code>spec.license</code></li><li>Your name and email address under <code>spec.author</code></li><li><a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#deployment_target">The deployment targets for each operating system</a></li><li>The <code>spec.source</code> to the repository url and git tag of the target version</li><li><code>spec.source_files</code> to <code>Sources/**/*.swift</code></li><li>The <code>spec.swift_versions</code></li></ul><p>Lastly we can verify our package is valid in our existing continuous integration by including <code>pod lib lint</code> within the macOS sections of our script.</p><h4>Setting Up An Example Project</h4><p>Additionally I would encourage creating an example project using your library with targets in each operating system. Moreover, we can also verify our example project builds. After creating the example project in a directory called Example, create a Podfile using <code>pod init</code>. Then update the <code>Podfile</code> by adding a reference to your pod in the parent directory:</p><pre><code>...
target 'iOS <span class="type">Example</span>' <span class="keyword">do</span>
  # <span class="type">Comment</span> the next line <span class="keyword">if</span> you don't want to use <span class="keyword">dynamic</span> frameworks
  use_frameworks!
  pod '<span class="type">PackageName</span>', :path =&gt; '../'

  # <span class="type">Pods</span> <span class="keyword">for</span> iOS <span class="type">Example</span>

end
...
</code></pre><p>Next to verify the build in our macOS continuous integration, include the following lines:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">if</span> [[ $TRAVIS_OS_NAME = 'osx' ]]; then
...
  swift package generate-xcodeproj
  pod install --silent --project-directory=<span class="type">Example</span>

You often have to use various tools and frameworks. Most likely Interface Builder (for apps on iOS and MacOS) as well as UIKit (for iOS and tvOS), to build the interface you want. While these are not bad tools, they do have issues and limitations. Apple has clearly developed SwiftUI to overcome or do away these challenges altogether.</p><h3>No more need for Storyboards or Imperative Programming</h3><p>Interface Builder is well-known for using storyboards: visual representations of the UI. Unfortunately, storyboards don't always accurately show what the code is doing. Storyboards do not structure information so it can be mastered or edited in one place. As a result, there is potential for misunderstanding because there's no <strong><em>Single Source of Truth</em></strong>, a practice developers use to prevent confusion. Typically, the storyboard might not show what's wrong if it's not aligned with the code. For this reason, <strong>bug fixing becomes especially difficult</strong></p><p>::: {.wp-block-group} ::: {.wp-block-group_<em>inner-container} ::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":55179,"title":"iOS App Architecture with René Cacheaux and Josh Berlin","episode<em>type":"full","number":14,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"June 2, 2019","duration":2137,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":36,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"35:37","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/7247db7e/e7236362.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/7247db7e","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/122/thumb</em>1533929410-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this episode, we talk with René Cacheaux and Josh Berlin, authors of Advanced iOS App Architecture.

If you need a simple UI and don't need custom functions, SwiftUI will probably work perfectly for you.</p><p><strong>SwiftUI is really great for the Apple Watch, which is coming into its own now.</strong> Since the Watch requires a simple UI, SwiftUI is an excellent choice because it will not only work natively but will work with any other Apple OS too.</p><h3>New Apps</h3><p>If you're going to build an app on for any Apple platform, you might as well start using SwiftUI. You will have all the functionality that Apple is able to provide within a single framework<strong>. This also goes for anyone with an app who wants to migrate it to other Apple systems.</strong></p><h3>For Tech-Savvy Users Using the Latest Apple Products</h3><p>SwiftUI is a good choice for apps designed for tech-savvy users who are using the latest Apple OS's, like iOS 13. The reason is Apple has developed SwiftUI to take advantage of the latest functionality. This includes things like Apple's improvements to UI design, UI transitions, animations, and how Dark Mode works.</p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/xcode-lansing-codes.png?fit=640%2C360&ssl=1" alt="<a href="https://github.com/brightdigit/lansingcodes-apple"><em>SwiftUI being used to build an app for local developer meetups in Lansing</em></a>"/><p>{.wp-image-1947}</p><h2>When is SwiftUI not a good choice?</h2><p>That all said, SwiftUI is not always the right choice. There are a few instances where you're either going to need something else, or you're not going to see the benefits:</p><h3>Older Apps</h3><p><strong>If you're using an app that's more than a few years old and still supports older Apple OS's, you're not likely to see any real benefit.</strong> There's nothing your users will really see or appreciate. You're probably better off sticking with UIKit or whatever framework you're using.</p><p>It's worth mentioning a downside of using SwiftUI right now: there's very little documentation. Because it's still so new, we're still spending a lot of time figuring out how everything works and how to use it. <strong>For now, this means there is significant learning time if you want to develop with it.</strong> For an older app, you're not likely to see a great return on investment.</p><h3>Users using Older Operating Systems or Devices</h3><p>Related to the above, one of the limitations of SwiftUI is it will only work with the latest Apple operating systems. It has no legacy compatibility. If you have users with older Apple products or who take a long time to update things, they are either going to struggle or simply not be able to use your new UI.</p><h3>Apps that need to be Android-compatible</h3><p>Finally, SwiftUI isn't going to help with apps that need to work on non-Apple systems. Swift is only used by Apple and SwiftUI only works in Swift. Therefore, you'll need a different framework if you want your app to work on Android, Windows, or a website.</p><p>I generally recommend not building these kinds of apps anyway, as they rarely deliver the experience that a native app can. <strong>I've talked about this on <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2019/07/17/empowerapps-show-cross-platform-comparison-with-rob-kerr/">my podcast</a> and <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2019/10/18/native-app-development-advantages/">my blog</a> if you're interested in learning more.</strong></p><h2>2020 is going to be an interesting year for Apple apps</h2><p>SwiftUI is likely going to make building apps for Apple products easier going forward. Especially if you're comfortable working within the limits of Apple's new framework. I think the people at Apple were thoughtful with this new framework and it will help create better interfaces for users.</p><p>If you're interested in learning more about SwiftUI, <strong>check out <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/tag/swiftui/">my Swift developer blog</a></strong> as well as:</p><ul><li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/">Apple's SwiftUI Tutorials</a></li><li><a href="https://thatthinginswift.com/should-you-use-swiftui-in-your-app/">Should you write your app in SwiftUI by Nick O'Neill</a></li><li><a href="https://rambo.codes/swiftui/2020/01/03/you-can-use-swiftui-today.html">You can use SwiftUI today By Gui Rambo</a></li><li><a href="https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/">Using Combine by Joseph Heck</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson</a></li><li><a href="https://goshdarnswiftui.com">Gosh Darn SwiftUI by Sarun Wongpatcharapakorn</a></li><li><a href="https://www.donnywals.com/understanding-combines-publishers-and-subscribers/">Understanding Combine's publishers and subscribers By Donny Wals</a></li><li><a href="https://swiftwithmajid.com/2019/11/27/combine-and-swiftui-views/">Combine and SwiftUI views by Majid Jabrayilov</a></li></ul><p>If you're interested in keeping up to date with what's new for iOS and Apple development, I invite you to <a href="https://brightdigit.com/subscribe/">sign up for my newsletter</a>.

For instance we can easily build something that doesn't meet client or customer needs. On the other hand, It's also fairly easy to build the right thing, but have it not work properly. A simple, reliable way to avoid this is by using <strong>Test-Driven Development</strong>.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/freestocks-org-40k6ZqbsXuo-unsplash-1024x683.jpg"/>{.wp-image-1862} :::</p><p>Test-Driven Development, or TDD, is a way to try to ensure good quality code which will do the job it's supposed to. This post is for anyone that employs or manages iOS developers and want to deliver better software for their customers.</p><p>We'll be explaining what TDD is, how it works, the advantages are of using TDD, and what you can do to empower your developers to meet customer needs.</p><h2>What is Test-Driven Development?</h2><p>Traditionally, requirements for a piece of software are given to the developer. Next the developer then writes what they believe is effective code to meet those requirements. Therefore with TDD, each component of the software is tested to make sure they do what they were designed to do. Specifically, this is known as <strong>Unit Testing</strong>. In this case, the <em>unit</em> is the smallest testable part of any software. Such as in iOS development, it's typically a <em>method</em> or <em>function</em> which contians a set of instructions.</p><p>Here is a simple example of a function in Swift, adding two numbers together:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> add (firstNumber : <span class="type">Int</span>, secondNumber: <span class="type">Int</span>) {
<span class="keyword">return</span> a + b 
}
</code></pre><p>In order to test this function, a typical unit test might look like this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> testAdd () {
<span class="comment">// test that the result is as expected</span>
<span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(<span class="call">add</span>(<span class="number">0</span>,<span class="number">0</span>), <span class="number">0</span>)
<span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(<span class="call">add</span>(<span class="number">1</span>,-<span class="number">1</span>), <span class="number">0</span>)
<span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(<span class="call">add</span>(<span class="number">100</span>,<span class="number">200</span>), <span class="number">300</span>)
<span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(<span class="call">add</span>(-<span class="number">10</span>,-<span class="number">20</span>), -<span class="number">300</span>)

</code></pre><p>Test-Driven Development inverts this process by using a <em>test-first</em> approach. So long as the requirements are provided, the developer always first writes the unit tests. Afterwards, the developer then writes the code necessary to succeed at the tests. As a result, the code should always meet the software requirements and generally be simpler and 'cleaner'. Additionally, the developer only wrote code for what was actually needed. Therefore, you end up with effective software that meets your customers' needs and has little that they don't need.<br></p><h2>What makes Test-Driven Development Great for iOS Development</h2><p>There are a number of benefits to using <em>Test-Driven Development</em> when building an iOS app. By and large, this broadly fits into two categories: <strong>Higher-Quality Software</strong> and <strong>Easier to Maintain</strong>.</p><h3>Higher-Quality Software</h3><p>One of the realities of software development is that the code for a piece of software will likely change. Typically, as both the developer and the business clarify and improve their understanding of the business problem they are trying to solve, the application needs to update accordingly.</p><p>When you have to write unit tests before you write the code, it forces you to decide what features you really. In practice, this means that the requirements need to have a high-degree of detail. As as result, so do the tests can be written based off them. Therefore, it is also almost guaranteed that problems will become clear very early forcing you to solve them.</p><p><em>TDD</em>, by its nature, focuses development on ensuring that the app works the way it was designed to. Additionally it will give the same experience regardless of which iPhone model you might be using.</p><p>The result of this is that final app will have far fewer bugs than other testing approaches. Consequently, this means more flexibility and easier maintainability of the code. As a result, this makes it easier to add new functionality later.</p><h3>Easier to Maintain</h3><p>So, you have an app that does exactly what it was designed to do, has fewer bugs, and is more flexible. For this reason, it naturally makes your app easier to maintain and update.</p><p>What this looks like on a technical level is that <em>TDD</em> forces developers to simplify their code. For one thing, if the code needs to pass a large number of unit tests, the developers would only write enough code to pass each test. As a result, A good developer using TDD will also structure their code in a way that's easy to modify. In the event a unit fails to pass a test, it's as easy to go back and fix whatever was causing the failure.</p><p>As a result, the developer will have to spend less time rewriting, reorganizing (known as refactoring), and debugging your app's code.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":59420,"title":"Test-Driven Development with Joshua Greene and Michael Katz ","episode<em>type":"full","number":15,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"June 16, 2019","duration":2824,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":47,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"47:04","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/eddb8632/a18c0801.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/eddb8632","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/122/thumb</em>1533929410-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this episode we talk with Joshua Greene and Michael Katz, authors of iOS Test Driven Development by Tutorials.

While it can vary, allowing for a learning period of 2-4 months is a good start.</p><p>First, for most developers, TDD is not easy to learn if they've used a test-first approach to building software. The biggest challenge will usually be a need to strengthen a developer's ability to map out the complex array of functionality for an app in the form of specific, planned tests, and their ability to question and review these tests if necessary. This is usually a steep learning curve.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://i0.wp.com/brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/alfons-morales-YLSwjSy7stw-unsplash.jpg?fit=640%2C376&ssl=1"/>{.wp-image-1868} :::</p><h3>TDD Resources</h3><p>A good start might be reading the seminal text of TDD: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321146530/ambysoftinc">Kent Beck's Test Driven Development: By Example</a>, the first authoritative text on the subject. Another good book, specifically for iOS and developers using Swift is <a href="https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/ios-test-driven-development">iOS Test-Driven Development by Tutorials, by Joshua Greene and Michael Katz</a>, which features a lot of examples and tutorials for you to master the basics of TDD. On a more technical level, we cover a lot of TDD-based scenarios and tutorials on <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/">Bright Digit's developer blog</a>.</p><p>Additionally, unit testing requires code to be written in order to carry out the testing. In TDD, this test code is just as important as the code of the app itself. Therefore, the code needs to be readable and with the minimum amount of code possible. As a result, this will usually translate into a lot of work, right at the start of a software project. Additionally. your deadlines and budget ideally should be configured to anticipate this reality. However, there will be less maintenance and more flexibility in your code in the long run. And as a result, it will result in more cost savings in the future.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":59420,"title":"Test-Driven Development with Joshua Greene and Michael Katz ","episode<em>type":"full","number":15,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"June 16, 2019","duration":2824,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":47,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"47:04","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/eddb8632/a18c0801.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/eddb8632","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/122/thumb</em>1533929410-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this episode we talk with Joshua Greene and Michael Katz, authors of iOS Test Driven Development by Tutorials.

The event told us a lot about their direction for 2020.</description><link>https://brightdigit.com/articles/4-things-apple-ios-2020</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 03:00:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple held a Special Event in September this year to introduce the iPhone 11, Apple Watch Series 5, and Apple Arcade.</p><p>The event told us a lot about the direction of Apple going into 2020, especially for those of us who develop apps for their platforms and want to know what will be the leading edge of innovations for their products. This is also useful for any business or organization that owns an iOS app or is planning to develop one.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://youtu.be/PzaoBmb6PjM :::</p><p>Here are the top four things that I think we all have to look forward to with Apple in 2020:</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bagus-hernawan-A6JxK37IlPo-unsplash-1024x512.jpg"/>{.wp-image-1799} :::</p><h2>A Slowdown in Innovation for iPhone</h2><p><strong>2019 may well be the year we have reached peak iPhone.</strong> The iPhone 11 series of phones are a clear demonstration of Apple's expertise and development of mobile phone hardware. However, <strong>the 11 doesn't really have any major hardware innovations compared to the iPhone X, although it is a big step up in performance from the iPhone 8</strong>. A clear indication of this was the emphasis on the camera technology above everything else.</p><p>This is really good news for those of us who are invested in iOS development. The iPhone has become a sophisticated and mature product. <strong>This means that now is a great time to be developing an iOS app. With the maturity of the iPhone where it is, we can rely on it to be a consistent, stable platform for the foreseeable future.</strong> Likewise in the future, if you have an app, or are developing an app, it will be relatively easy to maintain your app and there is a low risk of obsolescence if you want to add new features.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/daniel-korpai-hbTKIbuMmBI-unsplash-1024x512.jpg"/>{.wp-image-1800} :::</p><h2>Big Breakthroughs Coming for Apple Watch</h2><p>While the iPhone is maturing, the Apple Watch is just starting to get really good. The new Series 5 introduces noticeable improvements to its power usage, display and storage which show that the watch can be a viable platform. Most importantly, I was happy to see them introduce an always-on display, which makes it a lot easier to use.</p><p>At the same time, I don't think it's <em>quite</em> become an amazing product yet, but it's going to be within the decade at the latest. With a little more improvement to its battery and processor, it could become a great hardware platform.</p><p>That said, <strong>it means now is a great time to start thinking about developing an app for the Apple Watch, especially for organizations in the health and fitness sector</strong>. I would venture this could be the perfect platform to have a fitness app in the next year</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/roberto-nickson-hLgYtX0rPgw-unsplash-1024x512.jpg"/>{.wp-image-1801} :::</p><h2>Potential Change to How We Buy and Use iOS Apps</h2><p>Although not actually a new announcement, the promotion of Apple Arcade, and its actual launch several days later, is worthy of attention. Apple Arcade uses a subscription model for its video games and is accessible across all Apple platforms. Subscriptions for apps (video games are, after all, a kind of app) is something of a new tack for Apple and shows they are invested in exploring this. I think it's worth noting how great this could be, especially as it has already attracted some big game developers to get on board: Konami and Capcom. Also: good riddance to micro-transactions!</p><p><strong>I hope this will show is the potential for using subscriptions for apps, instead of outright purchases, and Apple expands this into other areas, most especially with their Pro Apps</strong>. This hopefully will improve Apple's app ecosystem, which is lackluster in a few areas -- notably with the new iPad. <strong>The iPad and especially iPad Pro, though a great piece of hardware, is sadly lacking in Pro apps.</strong> Maybe Apple will one day offer the Apple Arcade "bundle" approach for great iOS productivity apps, something the company Setapp is already doing on the Mac.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-19-at-1.35.01-PM-1024x512.png"/>{.wp-image-1802} :::</p><h2>SwiftUI Changing How We Develop User Interfaces</h2><p>SwiftUI, Apple's new user interface (UI) framework, is changing the way we develop UIs for all Apple products by making it easier to quickly develop a dynamic interface that is more flexible and better reflects how people actually use apps. This is happening slowly, as it requires a shift in the way many developers think about UI design, but it has more potential than other, older frameworks, like UIKit. As well, SwiftUI only supports the latest Apple operating systems (iOS 13, Catalina, etc.) and doesn't support certain kinds of widgets.</p><p>Without getting too technical, SwiftUI uses declarative programming, rather than an imperative (which is what UIKit uses). Declarative programming is similar to HTML, as it describes parameters of the UI of a software application, rather than specifying how to draw it on the screen. For example:</p><p><strong>Imperative</strong></p><pre><code>webpage.<span class="call">drawTitle</span>(“<span class="type">Title</span>”)
webpage.<span class="call">drawParagraph</span>(“<span class="type">Lorem Ipsum</span>”) 
</code></pre><p><strong>Declarative</strong></p><pre><code>&lt;title&gt;<span class="type">Title</span>&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;<span class="type">Lorem Ipsum</span>&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre><p>The other aspect of SwiftUI that makes it promising is that it is cross-platform compatible. This means you can now learn one programming language (Swift) and one framework<br>(SwiftUI), and you can create UIs for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. This is huge for developers, and will hopefully mean we can code for our customers faster, with more consistent, higher-quality results.</p><p>It's still a little early to know for sure what the full impact of SwiftUI will be, but it definitely something to keep an eye on. Time will tell.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://youtu.be/PzaoBmb6PjM :::</p><h2>Want to Get Ahead of the Curve?</h2><p>iOS app development is constantly changing and evolving, as you can see from what I've outlined above. Knowing what is helpful, unhelpful, or just important to recognize in the field often comes down to experience, being aware of trends, and having a sense of Apple's goals as a platform and service provider.</p><p>At Bright Digit, we are specialists in building apps for iOS. We are attuned to every announcement from Apple and how it could impact our craft.

While related, they are different concepts: <strong>UI refers simply to the point of interaction; UX on the other hand, refers how you to design a product and how you want the user to feel when they use it, the plan you have to get the user to interact with your app.</strong></p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/alex-wong-l5Tzv1alcps-unsplash-1024x512.jpg"/>{.wp-image-1791} :::</p><h3>Software Framework</h3><p><strong>A software framework can be best explained as a package of code and functionality that you can use to build software applications</strong>. We use this package to add certain app functions as well as to push software features much faster. Therefore you can focus on what you need for your app, rather than how it technically works.</p><p>For instance, a framework provided by Apple could help facilitate using GPS on your phone or fitness information from your Apple Watch. On the other hand, there are third-party libraries (libraries are pre-built lines of code that are commonly included in frameworks) to help developers track bugs and crashes in real-time or display common onboarding tutorials used in iPhone apps.</p><p>It is a bit like building or repairing a car: if you need a new muffler, rather than building one from scratch (which would take a lot of time and money), you would likely hire a mechanic or find a manufacturer who makes mufflers for cars. You can do this for everything from the wheels to the vehicle's sound system. Software development with frameworks is very similar.</p><p>Apple uses two main software frameworks: <strong>Cocoa (for macOS)</strong> and <strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/WhatIsCocoa/WhatIsCocoa.html">Cocoa Touch (for iOS)</a></strong>, which contain all the tools, features, and templates you need to build an application that will run on an Apple-built operating system.</p><h2>What kind of iOS developer do you need?</h2><p>To know what kind of a developer you need, namely either a general developer or someone with specialized knowledge and skills.</p><p>This goes back to <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2019/08/19/project-budget-ios-app/">an earlier article I put out on how to put together an accurate project budget for the app you want to develop</a>. If you haven't already read it, I invite you to go <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2019/08/19/project-budget-ios-app/">check it out here</a>.</p><p>Considerations for your app might include how you want it to look (and how much of a priority its appearance is for you), whether you need it to use different kinds of media (like video or audio), and how many requirements have very specific technical needs (such as an integrated payment system using <em>Stripe</em> or a similar platform).</p><p>The main consideration usually comes down to whether you need generalist or specialist developers. This is pretty straightforward: <strong>A generalist has the advantage of being able to adapt if you have a range of different requirements for your app, depending on what the requirements for your app are and how well they know the framework that you will need for your app.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, there are some things in iOS development that are either very specific or niche that you will need to find a specialist. For instance, you have an app that needs to connect to Bluetooth devices, you will need a developer that knows how to use a framework like <em><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth">Core Bluetooth</a></em>, which allows you to use certain Bluetooth devices with your app.</p><p>If you're not sure what functions you need for your app, and the possible ways of developing them, I recommend having a senior developer or consultant take a look at your project idea and have them map out a list of frameworks, libraries and tools that could be potentially used to develop your app, especially those that only a specialist would be expected to know. This way, you should have a suitable list of things that developers you want to hire should know or have experience using.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":48654,"title":"iOS Developer Interviews with Alex Bush","episode<em>type":"full","number":12,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"May 5, 2019","duration":2242,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":37,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"37:22","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/bcf9bb21/36e5889a.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/bcf9bb21","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/122/thumb</em>1533929410-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this episode we talk with Alex Bush (@alex</em>v<em>bush), Author of @iosinterviewgd and co-host of @insideiosdev.

With Storyboards, the developer creates images that show a "story" of how a user will interact with the app. Alternatively, some developers prefer to code their app through <em>UIKit</em> due to the limitations of <em>Storyboards</em>. However, with the introduction of <em><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a></em> this year, many developers have been moving away from <em>UIKit</em> and <em>Storyboards</em>, flocking to this new way to develop a user interface.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/marc-olivier-jodoin-TQUERQGUZ8-unsplash-1024x512.jpg"/>{.wp-image-1795} :::</p><h2>Can they be critically self-reflective?</h2><p>In the end, regardless of the method they choose, <strong>these choices reflect to how they build software and whether it will work with your team</strong>. In software, there are almost always lots of different ways of doing something: How to make an app function or look a certain way. Each way will also have pros and cons associated with it, and every developer will likely have a slightly different view of <em>good</em> ways developing an app.</p><p>A good developer should, first and foremost, be consistent in their approach to developing software and how they go about solving problems, and <strong>it is not unreasonable to expect them to be able to communicate the benefits and trade-offs of certain software practices and design patterns</strong> (i.e. solutions to recurring problems), and the limits of the libraries and frameworks they use, including what Apple might recommend for iOS and Apple developers.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/florian-krumm-yLDabpoCL3s-unsplash-1024x512.jpg"/>{.wp-image-1793} :::</p><h2>If they are front-end developers, do they at least know a little about the back-end?</h2><p>Just in case you're not already familar, <strong>front-end</strong> generally refers to the development of what users will directly interact with: the look, feel and design of your app. <strong>Back-end</strong> refers to the development of how your app actually works, how the application, as well as its server and databases, operate, and how it might interact with other pieces of software, as well as creating and implementing updates.</p><p>You will generally find that most iOS developers are specialized in front-end development. However, a few do know a bit of both front and back-end development (commonly called full-stack developers, a kind of generalist). Likewise, it is usually a good sign if a front-end developer knows a little bit about how to do back-end work. For instance how the app interacts with the back-end <em>Application Programming Interfaces</em> (APIs).</p><p>This is valuable, as a developer that has a rounded field of knowledge is much more useful when bugs or problems arise, as they will have an understanding how the UI work they may have done on the front-end relates back to the data storage and software architecture of the back-end, making it easier to identify problems and find solutions.</p><p>What you as the interviewer are looking for are developers that can show they understand how back-end development is related to what you need them to do. Do they know a little bit about business logic, software architecture, and back-end design patterns?</p><h3>Do they have experience with any specialties with hardware or APIs?</h3><p>As a subset of the above, specifically for iOS, it is usually worth asking what APIs and hardware they have worked with interfacing with iPhones. The more well-known ones include:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit">WatchKit</a></strong> for building Apple Watch App</li><li><strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/bluetooth/">Core Bluetooth</a></strong> for communicating directly with Bluetooth Devices</li><li><strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation">AVFoundation</a></strong> for dealing with camera hardware as well as video</li><li><strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata">CoreData</a></strong> for local database storage</li><li><strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation">CoreLocation</a></strong> for GPS and navigation services</li><li><strong><a href="https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning">CoreML</a></strong> for Machine Learning</li></ul><p>If you have a special need for your app, this can be very helpful. In fact it only means you would have access to their specialist knowledge. Markedly, it is a sign they have a mature level of knowledge of the Apple software ecosystem.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":48654,"title":"iOS Developer Interviews with Alex Bush","episode<em>type":"full","number":12,"season":1,"formatted</em>published<em>at":"May 5, 2019","duration":2242,"duration</em>in<em>minutes":37,"duration</em>in<em>mmss":"37:22","trackable</em>media<em>url":"https://pdcn.co/e/media.transistor.fm/bcf9bb21/36e5889a.mp3","share</em>url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/bcf9bb21","transcript<em>url":null,"artwork":"https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/122/thumb</em>1533929410-artwork.jpg","author":"Leo Dion, Principal CEO and Swift Developer at BrightDigit ","formatted<em>summary":"In this episode we talk with Alex Bush (@alex</em>v<em>bush), Author of @iosinterviewgd and co-host of @insideiosdev.

Therefore, here's a quick list of questions of the above:</p><h3>Before you start hiring</h3><ul><li>What are the <strong>functional requirements</strong> of your app?</li><li>Do you know <strong>what frameworks, libraries, and tools</strong> might be needed to develop that functionality?</li><li>Are you looking for <strong>generalist developers, specialists, or a mix</strong> of both?</li></ul><h3>During hiring</h3><ul><li>Can they build the kind of <strong>User Interface</strong> you will need for your app?</li><li>Do they employ <strong>Storyboards</strong> (if that is important or useful for developing your app)?</li><li>What <strong>process or philosophy</strong> do they follow in developing software?<ul><li>Are they aware of <strong>the benefits and trade-offs</strong> of their approach?</li><li>Is there <strong>evidence</strong> that they have considered other ways of doing the same kind of work?</li><li>If they are primarily a front-end developer, do they have knowledge, of the <strong>back-end development</strong> that will be needed to develop the app?</li><li>Do they have any <strong>specialist knowledge</strong> or experience working with certain kinds of software APIs or hardware?</li></ul></li></ul><p>Finally, if you're an iOS developer and are preparing to take an interview, I recommend you pick up <em><a href="https://gumroad.com/a/630830195"><strong>Alex Bush's book, The iOS Interview Guide</strong></a></em>. It's a great reference for helping you give clear answers to common questions, and articulate what you know in a way that is easy to understand</p><h2>If that seems like too much, we can help with that!</h2><p>Finding and hiring the right iOS or Apple developer can obviously be very complicated, and challenging if you yourself are not a developer. It could be very costly if you make the wrong choice, costing you time and money fixing the mistakes of the wrong kind of developer.</p><p>At BrightDigit, we work with our clients to make sure, before a single line of code is written, you have a clear plan of the work required to build your app, what kinds of tools, frameworks, and other resources that will be needed, and can even help you with that early step of putting together the list of things that your developers will need to know if your app is going to work the way you need it to. If you're ready to build an app for your business, **email us at</p><info@brightdigit.com>** and tell us about your app idea!]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/native-app-development-advantages</guid><title>native-app-development-advantages</title><description>For a more optimal user experience and easier maintenance, there are important reasons to consider native app development.</description><link>https://brightdigit.com/articles/native-app-development-advantages</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 05:59:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While cross-platform mobile development has become a trend when it comes to making apps, people still ask us regularly when it is worth getting an app developed natively. The fact is, you can get adequate results with cross-platform development tools in many instances. <strong>However, for a more optimal user experience and easier maintenance, there are important reasons to consider native app development.</strong></p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/featured_image-1024x512.png"/>{.wp-image-1753 width="1024" height="512"} :::</p><p>In this post, we'll cover the major reasons about when and why it's important to develop an app natively. Additionally, we'll talk about why you should have a specialist to help build or port the app to a new platform. Moreover we'll discuss:</p><ul><li><a href="#methods">The Different Methods of Developing An App</a></li><li><a href="#cross-platform">When Cross-Platform Might Be The Right Toolset</a></li><li><a href="#user-experience">User Experience and Native App Development</a></li><li><a href="#performance">Performance and Native App Development</a></li><li><a href="#maintainability">Maintainability and Native App Development</a></li></ul><h2>A Couple of Points on Terms... {#methods}</h2><p>While you're probably used to seeing many of these terms thrown around a lot, let's define them more clearly.</p><h3><strong>Native code (i.e. Swift or Objective-C)</strong></h3><p><strong>In software development, when we refer to native we are talking about using the programming language and toolset that's been designed for the device hardware.</strong> As an example, iPhone apps are meant to built using Xcode and coded in either Swift or Objective-C as designated by Apple.</p><h3><strong>Cross-Platform</strong></h3><p>Cross-platform development is an alternative method for building apps. Typically, the development team will bring their existing knowledge thereby reducing the friction of developing features for multiple platforms (i.e. Android and iOS). For example, let's say you need develop a shopping cart feature. Rather than writing in Swift for iPhone and then Kotlin or Java for Android, you can use one toolset for the same feature for both platforms. Typically, this is done by writing the code in a single language. The toolset then transforms the code into the native language of the platform. If needed, the toolset will provide additional frameworks so it can run on each supported platform (i.e. Android or iOS).</p><hr><p>This post is primarily about why you should write your app's code natively. Likewise, If you are going to go build for multiple platforms, we'll discuss why investing in having the multiple code bases is important. As well as why it delivers the best experience possible.</p><h2>Who this article isn't for {#cross-platform}</h2><p>There are many advantages to building an app in the native code of a platform, but before we get to them, we need to be clear we are assuming you are investing the time and effort to produce a high-quality app for your customers or clients with at least technically complex features that you plan to maintain for a long time.</p><p>If what you're looking for is more of a budget-limited app that's just for recording a grocery list or a minimum viable product for multiple platforms, then you're unlikely to find this article helpful ---the time, effort, and cost to code a native app isn't going to be anywhere close to the value you're going to get out of it.</p><h2>What Makes Native App Development So Great?</h2><p>There are a number of advantages to building an app in the native code of a platform, that can be broken down into three areas: <strong>User Experience, Performance, and Maintainability.</strong></p><p>NOTE: <em>At Bright Digit, we specialize in software development for Apple/iOS, so throughout this article, we'll often provide examples using iOS as an example. However, with perhaps a couple of exceptions, the principles we cover here apply equally in the context of Android or any other device platform.</em></p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/003-experience-300x300.png"/>{.wp-image-1757} :::</p><h3>Native User Experience {#user-experience}</h3><p>If you're part of a brand or company investing in creating a great app for your customers to use, than you want the best user experience possible. What this means can vary a little depending on whom you're talking to, but can be usually be boiled down to two key elements:</p><ol><li><strong>It is easy for the customer to use</strong> -- the customer can get the desired result they want from using the app in a way that is intuitive and doesn't require much, if any, complex actions.</li><li><strong>It is pleasing to use</strong> -- it is aesthetically attractive, consistent with the app's brand, and makes some effort to affirm the user's choices and actions on the app.</li></ol><p>When you code your app natively, it should come as no surprise that it is relatively easy to deliver a great user experience: you are working in a format that your device directly understands, so you can make full use of the platform's features and strengths. You don't need to go through any additional steps to create a user interface that looks natural and meshes perfectly with the device it is being used on.</p><h4>Guidelines, Conventions, and Expectations</h4><p>It also plays into user expectations: using iOS as an example, since most iPhone users know what a great app experience is like on their phone, you can meet that expectation, using the tools provided by Apple to build features using designs that are familiar and comfortable for them to use.</p><p>This is an important consideration, especially for those that might be thinking, that by developing a cross-platform app, they want a pixel-perfect identical experience on all devices -- this can be a bad idea. <strong>iOS and Android users have different expectations about what a great user experience is for their device</strong>. Each platform (including macOS, Windows, etc..) has established expectations and UI guidelines about how certain features work and how certain design elements appear. Google has put out <a href="https://material.io">their design guide known commonly as Material Design</a> and Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/">has human interface guidelines for their platforms</a> as well.</p><p>If you use a cross-platform tool to design an identical user interface on both platforms, the result is likely to be the application won't look quite right on one or all devices. If you try to duplicate a feature from one platform onto one that doesn't have that functionality, this could present bugs or unexpected behavior in the app, which leads to the next area...</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/004-speedometer-300x300.png"/>{.wp-image-1755} :::</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>An issue with cross-platform apps that are written in a non-native language is they require interpreters or some other kind of assistance in translating the code they are written into one the device understands.</p><p>Much like the real-life analogy of two people speaking with the aid of a human translator, this slows down communication. When one person says something, the interpreter takes a moment to think about what has been said, and then communicates that message in the native language of the other. Additionally, there may be limitations to what can be said if one language has a word for something that the other language does not (as a human language example, Finnish famously has no word for the English 'please' as in 'please and thank you'). Computers and smartphones have these same limits to their languages, a result of the needs and limitations of their human creators.</p><p><strong>When you code an app natively, these kinds of complications and limitations on performance are essentially a non-issue.</strong> It should also mean you will have cleaner code for your app that is easier to read and more consistent, both of which are important when considering...</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/005-settings-300x300.png"/>{.wp-image-1756} :::</p><h3>Native App Maintainability {#maintainability}</h3><p>If you're building an app that you plan to maintain for your customers for years, you ideally want make it relatively easy and cheap to maintain the code. When your app is written in native code, maintenance is simply easier to do, because it usually requires less code and fewer or no dependencies (in software, a dependency is when one piece of software relies on another piece of software to work), resulting in more <em>lightweight</em> app software.</p><p><strong>A natively developed app has the advantage of being written in one language that, provided it's up-to-date, has access to any new features you want to add, as well as a consistent way to find and fix bugs.</strong> This is especially important if your app has a lot of complex functions, requires a lot of the platform's resources, or needs to use a specific Application Programming Interface (API).

As an example, lets look at the two independent operations. In this case, we have a pink one which is processing image A and a blue one which is processing image B.</p><h3>Concurrency and Parallelism</h3><p>When these operations are scheduled by the operating system, they can be run <em>concurrently</em>. <strong>Concurrency</strong> means that the operation can be partitioned and run at the same time on the same processor.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/ParallelConcurrency.001-1024x768.jpeg" alt="The Difference Between Concurrency and Paralellism"/>{.wp-image-681 width="1024" height="768"} :::</p><p>In addition, when the operating system has access to multiple processing units or cores, it can also run the operations in <strong>parallel</strong>.

Moreover, <strong>concurrency</strong> and <strong>parallelism</strong> can be applied at the same time by the operating system. Most importantly for developers is to make our operations <strong>asynchronous</strong>, in order to allow for <strong>concurrency</strong> and <strong>parallelism.</strong></p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/The-Multi-Threaded-Asynchronous-Parallel-World-of-Swift-360iDev-copy.gif"/>{.wp-image-682 width="480" height="360"} :::</p><h3>Asynchronous Operations</h3><p>There are long operations, such as network requests, which are not well suited for standard synchronous operations. That is to say, by programming these calls synchronously, it will lock up other active operations such as user interface updates. Therefore making these calls asynchronous allows for other operations to be run concurrently. Specifically this is done in Swift, by including a completion closure or code block as a parameter. To put it differently, when the operation is completed that closure is executed on completion with a result passed.</p><p>For instance rather than actively waiting for a download to complete, the API allows the developer to pass what code they want the application to run when the operation is completed. Notably, this allows the operating system to schedule other operations in meantime like updating your UI. With this in mind, let's take a look at the several ways Swift developers already run into this.</p><h2>Where do we run into asynchronous operations? {#asynchronous-current}</h2><p>Swift developers are already taking advantage of concurrency with asynchronous functions in their applications. Primary there are three APIs we commonly see:</p><ul><li>Network Requests</li><li>NotificationCenter</li><li>Timers</li></ul><h3>Network Requests and URLSession</h3><p>Network requests are the most frequent example where asynchronous calls make the most sense. While the developer can call a <code>Data</code> constructor to pull contents from a url, Apple already provides an asynchronous method to do this:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> url = <span class="type">URL</span>(string:
 <span class="string">"https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/markdown.txt"</span>)!
<span class="type">URLSession</span>.<span class="property">shared</span>.<span class="call">dataTask</span>(with: url) {
 (data, response, error) <span class="keyword">in</span>
  ...
}.<span class="call">resume</span>()
</code></pre><p>In this example, a <code>URLSessionDataTask</code> is created with a callback which takes in the binary <code>Data</code>, the <code>URLResponse</code>, and possible <code>Error</code>. The API will handle the buffering of data and calculating when the request is complete. Additionally it will do it as a separate operation. As a result, the operating system can run other operations concurrently. Likewise <code>NotificationCenter</code> does this as well.</p><h3>NotificationCenter</h3><pre><code><span class="type">URLSession</span>.<span class="property">shared</span>.<span class="call">dataTask</span>(with: url) { (data, response, error) <span class="keyword">in</span>
  <span class="type">NotificationCenter</span>.<span class="property">default</span>.<span class="call">post</span>(name: notificationDownloaded, object: <span class="keyword">nil</span>)
}.<span class="call">resume</span>()

<span class="type">NotificationCenter</span>.<span class="property">default</span>.<span class="call">addObserver</span>(forName: notificationDownloaded, object: <span class="keyword">nil</span>, queue: .<span class="dotAccess">main</span>) { (notification) <span class="keyword">in</span>
  <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Notification Sent"</span>)
  <span class="type">PlaygroundPage</span>.<span class="property">current</span>.<span class="call">finishExecution</span>()
}

<span class="type">PlaygroundPage</span>.<span class="property">current</span>.<span class="property">needsIndefiniteExecution</span> = <span class="keyword">true</span>
</code></pre><p>In this example, when the download is complete, the application posts a notification to <code>NotificationCenter</code>. Additionally, theres an observer for the notification. Therefore, once the notification is received the Playground prints a message and finishes.</p><h3>Timers</h3><p>The application can take this further by adding a <code>Timer</code>, another asynchronous operation. <code>Timer</code> allows developers to delay or periodically repeat an operation. Once again, the API takes advantage of concurrency rather than locking up the application.</p><pre><code><span class="type">NotificationCenter</span>.<span class="property">default</span>.<span class="call">addObserver</span>(forName: notificationDownloaded, object: <span class="keyword">nil</span>, queue: .<span class="dotAccess">main</span>) { (notification) <span class="keyword">in</span>
  <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Notification Received"</span>)
  <span class="type">Timer</span>.<span class="call">scheduledTimer</span>(withTimeInterval: <span class="number">1.0</span>, repeats: <span class="keyword">false</span>) { <span class="keyword">_ in</span>
    <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Timer Activated"</span>)
    <span class="type">PlaygroundPage</span>.<span class="property">current</span>.<span class="call">finishExecution</span>()
  }
}
</code></pre><p>In this example, the code doesn't print the message as before. Rather, a <code>Timer</code> is initialized with a 1 second delay. Therefore when the time approaches, the Playground prints the message and completes.</p><p>Although these asynchronous abstraction offer a convenient way to optimize your applications, there are problems which do come up. Primarily on iOS, the developer isn't able to prioritize each operation. As a result, this is most noticeable is when the developer attempts to update the user interface.</p><h3>Asynchronous UI Updating with the Main Queue</h3><p>One of the first lessons, developers learn when developing for the iPhone or iPad is necessity to make user interface updates on the main thread or <code>DispatchQueue</code>. Whether it's simply updating a <code>UILabel</code> or a</p><p><code>UITableViewCell</code>, the UI update needs to be on the main</p><p><code>DispatchQueue</code>. Therefore, the operation needs to <em>hop</em> to another queue in order to complete the update to the user interface.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> timerSource = <span class="type">DispatchSource</span>.<span class="call">makeTimerSource</span>(flags: [], queue: .<span class="call">global</span>())
timerSource.<span class="call">setEventHandler</span> {
  <span class="type">DispatchQueue</span>.<span class="property">main</span>.<span class="call">async</span> {
    viewController.<span class="property">label</span>.<span class="property">text</span> = <span class="string">"Timer Activated"</span>
  }
}
timerSource.<span class="call">schedule</span>(deadline: .<span class="call">now</span>() + <span class="number">1.0</span>)

<span class="type">NotificationCenter</span>.<span class="property">default</span>.<span class="call">addObserver</span>(forName: notificationDownloaded, object: <span class="keyword">nil</span>, queue: .<span class="dotAccess">main</span>) { (notification) <span class="keyword">in</span>
  <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Notification Received"</span>)
  timerSource.<span class="call">activate</span>()
}
</code></pre><p>In this example, <code>DispatchSourceTimer</code> is created. <code>DispatchSourceTimer</code> is similar to <code>Timer</code>, however the developer has more control over the priority and the queue. As with the previous <code>Timer</code>, when the</p><p><code>Notification</code> is observed, the <code>Timer</code> is started with a 1 second delay. However since the <code>DispatchSourceTimer</code> is designated for using the <code>global</code> queue, it is nessecary to <em>hop</em> to the <code>main</code></p><p><code>DispatchQueue</code> and update a <code>UILabel</code> with the text <em>Timer Activated</em>. Consequently if this is not done, the user interface will not update correctly. Before I explain further how <code>DispatchQueue</code> and <em>Grand Central Dispatch</em> works, let's breakdown how operating systems schedule operations.</p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-24-at-2.04.19-PM.png?fit=640%2C438&ssl=1" alt="An example of the <em>top</em> command view of processes and threads"/><p>{.wp-image-719}</p><h2>How Operating Systems Handle Operations {#operating-systems}</h2><p>Operating System have two level of controlling operations: Processes and Threads.

Firstly let's discuss the most direct control of threads and processes and slowly evolve into the more abstract and easy to manage.</p><p>![Original Mac<br>(courtesy of</p><https://www.flickr.com/photos/befuddledsenses/493303884>)](https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/09/493303884_5c71fbcefb_o.jpg){.wp-image-720}

### Original Apple APIs {#original-apis}

Over the years, Apple has evolved its API for giving developers control
over their operations and their scheduling. At first, the API was pretty
basic and direct but has become increasing developer-friendly and given
more control to the operating system as to how to manage it.

#### Thread Class

Although this may be true, let\'s start by at least touching upon that
most direct API:
**[Thread](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/thread)**
(or NSThread in Objective-C). The Thread class gives the developer
direct access to creating actual threads. Their are two ways to do this:
pass in a closure to the initializer or subclass and override the *main*
method.

Although this API is available, I would recommend against using it
unless you absolutely have to. As you\'ll see, there are better
abstractions which give better control to the operating system and are
easy to maintain for the developer.

#### Process Class (for macOS only)

However there are occasions on the Mac, where you need to run a command
or external application. In that case it\'s best to use
[the](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/process)
**[Process](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/process)**
[class](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/process)
(or NSTask in Objective-C). With the Process class, you provide a url to
the executable and run:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let process = Process()
process.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/bin/ls")
process.terminationHandler = {
  _ in
  PlaygroundPage.current.finishExecution()
}

try process.run()
```

While directly creating threads takes control away from the API and
operating system, I think this is perfectly reasonable. In instances
where a piece of functionality is already available on macOS running
another outside process makes sense. As with many operations, it is
important to make sure it does not interfere with the user experience.
While there\'s the function `waitUnitExit` in order which provides a
synchronous result from the operation, using the property
`terminationHandler`, allows for asynchronous callback. That is to stay,
using `terminationHandler` allows the application to do other operation
as it waits for that process to finish.

### Working with Queues and Asynchronous Operations {#queue-apis}

While the Process and Thread class gives developers direct control,
Apple has introduced more abstract ways of dealing with operations. At
the top of those abstraction is the all important **Grand Central
Dispatch.**

#### Grand Central Dispatch

Grand Central Dispatch is by far the most used API for dealing with
parallelism and concurrency through asynchronous operations. Specially,
the most important class in that API is the **DispatchQueue** class.
DispatchQueue allows for the developer to control the scheduling of
operations. Additionally, the developer can guide some more abstract
aspects regarding how the operating system organizes the operations.

For instance, if we were to count from 0 to 1000 within a Playground in
two different DispatchQueues: the high-priority main queue and the
lower-priority global queue, the code would look like this:

``` {.wp-block-code}
PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution = true

DispatchQueue.global().async {
  var value = 0
  repeat {
    print("glob", value)
    value += 1
  } while(value < 1000)
}

DispatchQueue.main.async {
  var value = 0
  repeat {
    print("main", value)
    value += 1
  } while(value < 1000)
  PlaygroundPage.current.finishExecution()
}
```

By doing this, we would see the counting for each queue interleaved with
each other:

``` {.wp-block-code}
...
main 947
glob 814
glob 815
main 948
glob 816
main 949
glob 817
main 950
glob 818
main 951
glob 819
main 952
main 953
...
```

In the example above the developer can control the priority or queue of
the code block, however there are more ways we can control the
DispatchQueue through the use of flags, quality of service and
attributes:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let barrierQ = DispatchQueue(label: "barrier", qos: .default, attributes: .concurrent)
…
barrierQ.async{
  markdownFiles.append(text)
}
```

As we can see, we\'ve created our own DispatchQueue and noted that it is
*concurrent*. In other words, while the each operation we add is run in
order, the following operation will not wait for the previous operation
to complete. What must be remembered is that running multiple operations
concurrently can result in what\'s called a **Race Condition**.

##### Dealing with Race Conditions in GCD

A Race Condition is where multiple operations are dependent on a single
changeable object or variable resulting in the possibility in an error.
For instance here\'s an example of a Race Condition issue using the
Thread class API:

``` {.wp-block-code}
func increaseTo(_ max: Int) {
  var next:Int
  repeat {
    next = (items.last ?? 0) + 1
    Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 0.1)
    items.append(next)
  }
  while (next <= max)
}
```

As a result of running this in two separate threads, we could get
something like this:

``` {.wp-block-code}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
10 // 😱 Oh No! 😱
11 // 😢
11 // 😭
```

Luckily Grand Central Dispatch provides two ways of resolving this
through barriers: semaphores and flags.

###### Semaphores in GCD

A great use of the DispatchSemaphore is in the Thread example:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 1)

func increaseTo(_ max: Int) {
  var next:Int
  repeat {
    semaphore.wait()
    next = (items.last ?? 0) + 1
    Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 0.1)
    items.append(next)
    semaphore.signal()
  }
  while (next <= max)
}
```

In this example, we are more or less locking down the reading and
writing to the array so it only can be executing by one thread at a
time. In other words, the operation between `.wait()` and `.signal()` is
executing *atomically*.

###### Barriers using DispatchWorkItemFlags

In contrast, with a DispatchQueue, we can provide a flag to ensure the
`markdownFiles` is accessed *atomically*, we can use the `.barrier`
flag:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let barrierQ = DispatchQueue(label: "barrier", qos: .default, attributes: .concurrent)
…
barrierQ.async(group: nil, qos: .default, flags: .barrier) {
  markdownFiles.append(text)
}
```

##### Organizing Multiple Operations with DispatchGroup

Besides DispatchQueue another great use of Grand Central Dispatch is
**DispatchGroup**. For instance, if you have multiple asynchronous
operations which are not dependent on each other such multiple url
calls, DispatchGroup is perfect. DispatchGroup allows the developer to
track their asynchronous completion as a whole:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let group = DispatchGroup()
let count = 20
var markdownFiles = [String](repeating: "", count: count)

for index in (0..<count) {
  group.enter()
  DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background)
  .async {
    markdownFiles[index] =
      try! String(contentsOf: url)
    group.leave()
    print(index)
  }
}
```

In the example above, we create a DispatchGroup. Next, the code
asynchronously downloads 20 markdown files and sets the result in the
array. Markedly, each time `group.enter()` is called when the process
starts and `group.leave()` is called to note that particular operation
is completed. Lastly, the developer can call either `notify` or `wait`
on the DispatchGroup depending on whether to wait asynchronously or
synchronously.

One of the more complex natures of multiple asynchronous operations is
organizing dependencies. Therefore let\'s discuss the next level of
abstraction which specialized in dependencies - OperationQueues.

#### Operation Queues

An older yet more abstract API for dealing with multiple Operations is
the OperationQueue (or NSOperationQueue in Objective-C). A preferred
method for dealing with operations, OperationQueues are fairly to simple
to get started:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let operation = BlockOperation {
  for index in 1...100 {
    print(index)
  }
}
OperationQueue.main.addOperation(operation)
```

In this example, we simply add a BlockOperation to the main queue and it
will automatically start printing out 1 to 100. Most importantly, its
with dependencies where OperationQueue shows their potential:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let operation = BlockOperation {
  for index in 1...100 {
    print(index)
  }
}
let anotherOperation = BlockOperation {
  for index in 101...200 {
    print(index)
  }
}
anotherOperation.addDependency(operation)
OperationQueue.main.addOperation(anotherOperation)
OperationQueue.main.addOperation(operation)
```

In the above example, we add a dependency of one operation (0\...100) to
another (101\...200) to ensure that the counting is in the correct
order. As a result, regardless of the order of how the operations are
added, dependent operation is executed first. For this reason, the
developer can add operations in whatever fashion as long as their
dependencies are setup beforehand.

##### Problems with OperationQueue

While dependency management is easier with OperationQueues, there a
couple of issues which showcase it\'s dated Objective-C outlook.
Firstly, there is no native method for doing asynchronous operations in
the Operation (or BlockOperation) class. In other words, the developer
must subclass the Operation and optimize the code for asynchronous
operations or convert the underlying method to an synchronous method.
Secondly, there is no native way to deal with results or errors of each
operation. Therefore, the developer must handle the result of each
operation outside of the operation.

Instead a more modern and functional method for handling asynchronous
methods and their results or errors comes in the form of Promises and
Futures.

:::

### Promises and Futures of Better Asynchronous APIs {#promise-future}

While Apple provides some abstractions for asyncronous operations, Swift
developer will often run into the dreaded *callback hell*

``` {.wp-block-code}
doThis{
  thenThis{
  andThenThis{
    lastlyThis{
      }
  }
  }
}
```

This awful mess of code can be difficult to manage especially when
catching error and dealing with various logic. As much as closures are
superior to Objective-C code blocks, other programming languages such as
JavaScript and C\# have improved on this with the concept of *promises*
and *futures*. In short, where a synchronous function returns a value,
this abstraction allows for the returning of a *promised future* value.

``` {.wp-block-code}
let thatPromise = doThis(...)
let thenThisPromise = thatPromise.then(thenThis)
let andThenThisPromise = thenThisPromise.then(andThenThis)
let lastPromise = andThenThisPromise.then(lastlyThis)
```

Therefore, let's take a look at a couple of Swift libraries: SwiftNIO
and Google's Promise library.

#### SwiftNIO - Asynchronous on the Server

While Swift\'s largest focus has been on the iPhone, it is important to
note that the server is where asynchronous operations often occur.
Whether the server is making HTTP calls to the outside or accessing a
database, it has to wait for the completion of network requests.
Therefore, it's no wonder that SwiftNIO the backbone of the main
server-side frameworks, Kitura and Vapor, employs its own Promise and
Future infrastructure. While server-side Swift mostly uses SwiftNIO,
Apple devices such as the iPhone can also use the package.

``` {.wp-block-code}
public func setupSite(_ site: Site, withTheme theme: Theme, _ completed: @escaping (Error?) -> Void)

public func setupSite(_ site: Site, withTheme theme: Theme, using eventLoop: EventLoop) -> EventLoopFuture<Site> {
  let promise = eventLoop.makePromise(of: Site.self)
  eventLoop.execute {
    self.setupSite(site, withTheme: theme) { error in
      if let error = error {
        promise.fail(error)
      } else {
        promise.succeed(site)
      }
    }
  }

  return promise.futureResult
}
```

In this example, there is an asynchronous function which sets up a
website based on a theme. Namely, this function takes as parameters, the
site, the theme, and a closure which takes in an `Error` if the
operation failed. Given that, for the purpose of using Futures, there is
a new method which returns SwiftNIO's `Future` or `EventLoopFuture` with
the resulting `Site` object.

Notably, in Swift, some sort of queue, thread, or loop must be specified
in order to assign where the operation will be executed. Likewise,
SwiftNIO uses the `EventLoop` to designate where the operation will be
executed. Therefore, from the `EventLoop`, an `EventLoopPromise` is
created. Next, from the `EventLoop` a closure is passed where the
original asynconous `setupSite` function is called. From inside the
closure, a success or failure state on the promise is set using `.fail`
and `.succeed`. Lastly, the promise has a property which contains the
*future* using `.futureResult`.

``` {.wp-block-code}
let future = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme, using: eventLoop)
future.whenComplete {
  ...
}
```

In most cases, the `EventLoop` is accessed from originating
`HTTPRequest` or `Application`. In any case, to call our `Future`
returning function and do something with the value, `whenComplete` to
set the callback on the resulting operation.

##### Functional Programming in SwiftNIO

The other advantage of *promises* and *futures*, is being able to apply
functional programming concepts to *future* results.

``` {.wp-block-code}
let futureSite = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme, using: eventLoop)
// returns a Future<String>
let futureString = futureSite.map{
  $0.name
}

// flatMap "flattens" the Future<Future<String>> to just
// Future<String>
let futureHTML = futureSite.flatMap{
  // return Future<String>
   promise(fromAsyncLoadingSite: $0)
}

let sites: [Future<Site>]
// flatten "flattens" [Future<String>] to Future<[String]>
let siteNamesFuture = sites.map{ site in site.map{
  $0.name
}.flatten(using: eventLoop)

let nameAndHTML : Future<(String, String)> = futureString.and(futureHTML)
```

Therefore, with SwiftNIO:

-   `.map`\
    -   converts `Future<A>` to `Future<B>` by
    -   taking in a closure of type: `(A) -> (B)`
-   `.flatMap`\
    -   converts `Future<A>` to `Future<B>` by
    -   taking in a closure of type: `(A) -> (Future<B>)`
-   `.flatten`\
    -   converts `[Future<A>]` to `Future<[A]>` by
    -   taking in an `EventLoop`
-   `.and`\
    -   on `Future<A>` and takes in a `Future<B>` **or** `B`
    -   returns a `Future` tuple of type `Future<(A,B)>`

Unfortunately since network operation and server-side communication are
at the center of SwiftNIO, the only way currently to create an
`EventLoop` on iOS is by using a `MultithreadedEventLoopGroup`:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let pool = MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup(numberOfThreads: 5)
let eventLoop = pool.next()
```

However, a better library to implement *promises* on iOS (and other
client devices) is Google's own *Promise* framework.

#### [Google Promises](https://github.com/google/promises) - Asynchronous on the Client

While Apple makes SwiftNIO and it contains a great implementation of
*Futures* and *Promises*, it is focuses on server-side and networking
related implementation. However, on the client, Google Promises might be
amongst the best *Promise* APIs for Swift.

``` {.wp-block-code}
public func setupSite(_ site: Site,
  withTheme theme: Theme,
  on queue: DispatchQueue = .main) -> Promise<Site> {
  return Promise<Site>(on: queue) { success, failure in
    self.setupSite(site, withTheme: theme) { error in
      if let error = error {
        failure(error)
      } else {
        success(site)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

While SwiftNIO required the proprietary `EventLoop`, **Google Promises**
requires the familiar `DispatchQueue`. Therefore to create a `Promise`
oriented version of `setupSite`, the function needs a `DispatchQueue`
parameter and needs to return a `Promise` on that `DispatchQueue` with a
closure that calls either `success` or `failure` depending on the
result. Therefore to call the method, the code needs to pass a
`DispatchQueue` and on the `Promise` call `.then` to use the result.

``` {.wp-block-code}
let futureSite = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme, on: .main)
// returns a Promise<String>
let futureString = futureSite.then{
  $0.name
}

// returns a Promise<String>
let futureHTML = futureSite.then{
  // return Promise<String>
   promise(fromAsyncLoadingSite: $0)
}

let sites: [Promise<Site>]
// `all` "flattens" [Promise<String>] to Future<[Promise]>
let siteNamesFuture = all(sites.then{ site in
  site.map{
    $0.name
  }
)

let nameAndHTML : Promise<(String, String)> = all(futureString, futureHTML)
```

##### Functional Programming in Google Promise

Additonally while SwiftNIO differentiated `.map`, `.flatMap`, and
`.whenComplete`, **Google Promise** simplifies it into `.then`:

-   `.then`
    -   converts `Promise<A>` to `Promise<B>` by
    -   taking in a closure of type:
        -   `(A) -> (B)` or
        -   `(A) -> (Promise<B>)`
-   `all`
    -   converts `[Promise<A>]` to `Promise<[A]>` or
    -   converts `(Promise<A>, Promise<B>, …)` into `Promise<(A,B,…)>`

Additionally, Google Promises also has a specific method for dealing
with Error or failure states:

-   `.catch`
    -   a `Void` method which takes a closure of type: `(Error) -> Void`

As a result to fulfill a `Promise`, use either `then` and `catch` or
`fulfill` and `reject`:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let future = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme, on: .main)
future.fulfill {
  // on success
  ...
}.reject{
  // on error
  …
}
```

#### [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit) - Popular Alternative

The most popular alternative for Swift and Objective-C is PromiseKit by
Max Howell. PromiseKit uses a more English-like syntax then the previous
examples.

``` {.wp-block-code}
public func setupSite(_ site: Site,
  withTheme theme: Theme) -> Promise<Site> {
  return Promise<Site>{ resolver in
    self.setupSite(site, withTheme: theme) { error in
      if let error = error {
        resolver.reject(error)
      } else {
        resolver.fulfill(success)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

While you can specify the `DispatchQueue`, with PromiseKit [it\'s
typically not
necessary](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit/blob/master/Documentation/FAQ.md#how-do-i-change-the-default-queues-that-handlers-run-on).
Promises use a `Resolver` which has methods which can take variety of
combinations for success or failure including a Result object. Similar
to Google Promises, you can call `.then` to make another asynchronous
call or `.map` for a synchronous mapping.

``` {.wp-block-code}
let futureSite = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme)
// returns a Promise<String>
let futureString = futureSite.map{
  $0.name
}

// returns a Promise<String>
let futureHTML = futureSite.then{
  // return Promise<String>
   promise(fromAsyncLoadingSite: $0)
}

let sites: [Promise<Site>]
// `all` "flattens" [Promise<String>] to Future<[Promise]>
let siteNamesFuture = when(sites.map{ site in
  site.map{
    $0.name
  }
)

let nameAndHTML : Promise<(String, String)> = when(futureString, futureHTML)
```

##### Functional Programming in PromiseKit

Similar to SwiftNIO, PromiseKit differentiates between synchronous and
asynchronous mappings:

-   `.map`
    -   converts `Promise<A>` to `Promise<B>` by
    -   taking in a closure of type: `(A) -> (B)`
-   `.then`
    -   converts `Promise<A>` to `Promise<B>` by
    -   taking in a closure of type: `(A) -> (Promise<B>)`
-   `when`
    -   converts `[Promise<A>]` to `Promise<[A]>` or
    -   converts `(Promise<A>, Promise<B>, …)` into `Promise<(A,B,…)>`

Additionally, similar to Google Promises, PromiseKit has two ways of
handling errors:

-   `.catch`
    -   a `Void` method which takes a closure of type: `(Error) -> Void`
-   `.recover`
    -   a `Promise<T>` method which takes a closure of type:
        `(Error) -> Promise<T>`

As a result to fulfill a `Promise`, use `done` and `catch`:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let future = setupSite(site, withTheme: theme)
future.done {
  // on success
  ...
}.catch{
  // on error
  …
}
```

However while *Promises* and *Future* are certainly a better way to
avoid *callback hell*, there are recent updates which emphasis the
important of user interface responsive. That is to say rather functional
emphasis on optimal operations, this emphasizes the reactive nature of
UI development: **Combine**

### Combine-ing It All Together {#combine}

With **SwiftUI**, Apple has snuck in a whole other framework for
managing asynchronous tasks: **Combine**. With **Combine**, Apple is
introducing an asynchronous model more reflecting the
Subscriber-Publisher model used in reactive programming.

#### Reactive UI Focused Asynchronous Operations

While Promises and Futures handle how to deal with the results of
asynchronous operations, Combine focuses on reacting to multiple changes
in multiple locations. For instance, a Publisher issues changes to data
and a Subscriber listens to the those changes. Therefore SwiftUI becomes
the ideal use case for using Combine with data changes. For instance, if
we have a SwiftUI View which displays the header from a downloaded
markdown file:

``` {.wp-block-code}
struct ContentView: View {
  @ObservedObject var nameObject: ContentObject
  
  var body: some View {
    Text(nameObject.name)
  }
}
```

In this case, this SwiftUI View contains a ObservedObject with a name
property, which is the name or header of the ContentObject. Therefore,
let's take a look at the content object:

``` {.wp-block-code}
class ContentObject: ObservableObject {
  let publisher : AnyPublisher<String, Never>
  var cancellable : AnyCancellable!
  @Published var name : String = "" {
    willSet {
      objectWillChange.send()
    }
  }
  
  static fileprivate func markdownTitlePublisher(fromURL url: URL) -> AnyPublisher<String, Never> { … }
  
  init () {
    self.publisher = ContentObject.markdownTitlePublisher(fromURL: ContentObject.url)
    self.cancellable = self.publisher.receive(on: DispatchQueue.main).sink{ self.name = $0 }
  }
}
```

In this instance, there is an initializer which creates the publisher
for the markdown file's `h1` name . Inside the initializer, we create a
publisher for the name, followed by setting up the assignment of the
result to the name property. Firstly, it creates the publisher. Next,
similar to before with UIKit updates, the code tells the publisher that
it must receive the changes on the main DispatchQueue. Lastly, it tells
the publisher to assign the value to the name property on self. With the
initializer, the code has setup the publisher for the `name` of the
content, a cancellable for the publisher assignment, and the
`@Published` property of the name. Therefore, let's breakdown how the
publisher is created in `ContentObject.markdownTitlePublisher(forURL:)`:

``` {.wp-block-code}
static fileprivate func markdownTitlePublisher(fromURL url: URL) -> AnyPublisher<String, Never> {
  return URLSession.shared.dataTaskPublisher(for: url).tryMap { (arg: URLSession.DataTaskPublisher.Output) throws -> String  in
    let (data, _) = arg
    let text = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
    guard let value = text?.components(separatedBy: .newlines).first else {
      throw InvalidTextError()
    }
    return value
  }.catch({ (error) in
    return Just(nil)
  }).compactMap{ $0 }.eraseToAnyPublisher()
}
```

##### Functional Programming with Combine

Luckily, Combine provides already built-in methods for publishers for
the three main asynchronous APIs, which I talked about previously:
NotificationCenter, Timer, and URL tasks. In this case, let's look at
how URL Task publisher transforms to useable String value for the name
property:

1.  `tryMap` reads the first line of text by decoding the binary `data`
    into text and reading the first line.
2.  `catch` converts the useless error into nil\...\
    **For a SwiftUI View to use a publisher, the publisher must always
    handle the error in order to assign the value.**
3.  `compactMap` removes any nil values from the publisher pipeline
4.  `eraseToAnyPublisher` uses type erasure to remove the specifics
    conversions taken place.

Therefore, with all the plumbing in place, SwiftUI and Combine will
display the display the first line of the markdown file.

In conclusion, Combine really shows it's power when it comes to UI
updates (not just SwiftUI but UIKit, AppKit, etc...) and any situation
where reactive programming makes sense such as when there are multiple
publishers and subscribers. However if you are comfortable with Promises
and Futures and your code is more simple and straightforward it's
perfectly reasonable to go with that method.

### Coroutines - The Future of Asynchronous Operations {#coroutines}

Before closing out, there has been proposals for making Promises and
Futures native in Swift along with the syntactic sugar some common in
other languages known as **Coroutines**. (Read more about **Coroutines**
in [Chris Latner's
proposal](https://gist.github.com/lattner/429b9070918248274f25b714dcfc7619).)
Let's take a look at our earlier example:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let url = URL(string:
 "https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/markdown.txt")!
URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) {
 (data, response, error) in
  …
}.resume()
```

In this case, a closure is based as a parameter along with a task.
However a Promise or Future might look something like this:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let url = URL(string:
 "https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/markdown.txt")!
let promise : Future<(Data?, HttpResponse?, Error?)> = URLSession.shared.data(with: url) 
```

With syntactic sugar like `async` and `await`, it become even cleaner
with:

``` {.wp-block-code}
let url = URL(string:
 "https://jaspervdj.be/lorem-markdownum/markdown.txt")!
let response = await URLSession.shared.data(with: url) 
```

To declare a method as being asynchronous and wrap a previous method
(using a `callbackWrap` method for now) such as `setupSite` previously:

``` {.wp-block-code}
public func setupSite(_ site: Site, withTheme theme: Theme) async throws -> Site {
  return await callbackWrap { continuation in
  self.setupSite(site, withTheme: theme) { error in

      if let error = error {
        continuation(error)
      } else {
        continuation(site)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With `async` and `await` along with `Combine`, Swift can really take
advantage of asynchronous programming both from the simple
Promise/Future mindset as well as the Reactive programming paradigm.

## What's the Right Toolset?

In conclusion, developers have some key decisions when it comes to the
best way to deal with asynchronous, parallelism, and concurrency:

-   Take Advantage of Your Hardware - make sure not to lock down the
    whole device or application with one thread but allow for many
    actions to take place simultaneously
-   Avoid Convoluted Logic in favor of Easy Maintenance - make it easier
    for the *next* developer to update your code, don't over optimize
    without componentizing
-   Provide Fast UI Experience over a Speedier Logic - giving healthy
    feedback to the user of what's going on is more important than a
    faster application - again avoid freezing your app and device
-   Use Abstractions As Much As Possible - unless you are into highly
    processor intense applications - use Apple's provided abstractions
    (i.e. Combine, etc..) rather lower-level direct APIs (i.e. Threads)
-   Avoid Callback Hell with Promises and Futures - for simple non-UI
    code use Promises and Futures to organize multiple asynchronous
    calls as opposed to a pyramid of callbacks
-   For UIs on the latest Operating Systems (iOS 13, watchOS 6, tvOS 13,
    Catalina) use Combine - Combine gives the OS better control of the
    flow multiple asynchronous operations using reactive patterns

Hopefully this article gives you more guidance on how to better manage
multiple operations and optimize your application for a better user
experience. I am looking forward to even better APIs with Swift in the
future.

A quick look in the App Store might convince you that everyone has one and they are easy to make. However, creating a good-quality app is usually a lot of work.</p><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/przemyslaw-marczynski-oCfkSnqZ0SI-unsplash-e1565882465407-1024x512.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-1702}</p><p>That said, with a little knowledge about how an app is created, creating a budget doesn't need to be daunting. I've got some tips to help you with what to consider in developing an app for your business.</p><p>I'll be covering how to figure out both the time and cost of coding, designing and delivering an app to your customers and what kinds of things you should be talking to your developer about before work gets started.</p><h2>What does your app need to do?</h2><p>If you approach any good developer with a proposal to have an app built, the first thing they are going to ask is "What do you need the app to do?" An app, at its most basic level, is a set of functions that allow specific actions to be taken: for example, if you run a consultancy, you may want an app with a function that allows customers to book meetings with you. If you have a restaurant that delivers, you probably want a function that allows your customers to search your menu; another for them add items to their bill; another for them to pay.</p><p>All these elements are considered by a developer when they are putting together a quote for you, which will include how many functions and screens the app will need and how they will behave in different situations. As well, if you need the app to integrate with third-party services, such as Facebook or a credit payment system, or if the app relies on any special controls or sensors, these will also contribute to a higher quote.</p><h2>Has somebody already done it?</h2><p>I'm always surprised how many times people come with a great idea for an app, but haven't checked the App Store to see if something like it already exists. Not only is this is easy to do, but it's also a simple way to find out how well, or how difficult, an app idea could be to build and deliver. It can also reveal issues you may not have initially thought of, like how the app handles edge cases or exceptions. This comes up more often than you might imagine, turning something that might have seemed simple into a need for something complex.</p><p>As an example, we here at BrightDigit built a nurse training app that covered certification requirements for different States. This, while it might seem simple, turned out to be complex to create, because many users needed ways of tracking their certification training credits in two or more States and credits for each requirement needed to be tracked separately. It certainly wasn't something the client thought was going to be needed, and while many of the app's users didn't need it, it ended up being a necessary feature.</p><h2>How well do you need it done?</h2><p>Another factor to consider is the level of quality you need for your app. Assuming you've hired a reputable developer, the more time and money you can provide them, the higher quality the app will be: things like a more attractive and easy-to-use user interface, fewer bugs and a way to handle them, or whether you can use the app offline.</p><p>Additionally, you need to consider what devices your app can run on. Do you only need it to run on the latest iPhone operating system? What about iPads? Android devices? Desktop computers? Generally speaking, it is worth spending time finding out what kinds of devices your customers use so you only spend resources coding for platforms that are necessary.</p><h3>How an iOS App can be coded?</h3><p>Levels of build quality are one of the biggest differentiators between developers. It is possible to get significantly different quotes for the same app depending on how well it's made. While there are many factors that might have bearing on this, the main one is how the app is coded:</p><h4>Native</h4><p>Generally speaking, if you want a better-quality app, you will want it coded in the native programming language of the device you want it to run on. Creating a native app allows the greatest level of control and customization, and are often the best-looking, as they can use all the tools and features of the operating system.</p><h4>Templates</h4><p>Some developers might save time and money on app development by using app templates. Effectively, these use premade designs that allow you to add and arrange common app functions. These often have little room for customization or being able to change things later, making them a poor choice if you're looking for a good long-term investment in an app.</p><h4>Cross-Platform Tools</h4><p>Another option that some developers go with is using an application framework, which allows developers to build apps in a script or language other than the one natively used by an operating system. This also has some limits on what you can build into the app.</p><h4>Web Page Wrappers</h4><p>Another way is to use a web development wrappers. With this method, you create a web page and have it display as if it were an app. There are some considerable limitations to what you can do with this method though, and shouldn't be used for anything but the simplest of needs.</p><h2>How will your app be delivered to your customers?</h2><p>A smaller consideration than the ones above, but can be surprising for those new to app development, is it can take significant time to get an app into the App Store or Google Play. All sorts of issues might need to be addressed before your app meets the requirements Apple or Google have for putting it in their stores. As well, you should have all your marketing and design assets ready, which are needed to get into the stores. By planning ahead and knowing the requirements of the store before work gets started, you can save yourself significant time and money later on.</p><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kaleidico-26MJGnCM0Wc-unsplash-e1565882532230-1024x512.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-1703}</p><h2>Things to Keep in Mind</h2><p>There are many factors to consider when building an app and creating a realistic project budget:</p><ul><li>Functionality</li><li>Has it already been built?</li><li>Build quality</li><li>Form of delivery</li></ul><p>...and that's only scratching the surface. There are also factors like testing to consider, which we'll cover in a different post. However, the above is a good starting point for putting together a realistic project budget and having an effective discussion with a prospective developer.</p><h2>Do you want a well-designed app that delights your customers?</h2><p>When we work with clients to help them build apps, we want to make sure they can stay within their budget and don't end up with unnecessary features. Often with new clients, we suggest building a proof of concept of their app idea, so they can quickly put it in front of their customers and discover what features they actually need. Then, when they're ready, we help them build the full-fledged app.</p><p>If that sounds like the experience you want to have in developing a successful app, <strong><a href="https://brightdigit.com/contact/">contact us here</a></strong> and tell us about your ideas!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/best-backend-for-your-ios-app</guid><title>best-backend-for-your-ios-app</title><description>Choosing the best backend for your iOS App can be a challenge. Our guide to questions on app servers, databases &amp; cloud services.</description><link>https://brightdigit.com/articles/best-backend-for-your-ios-app</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jul 2019 12:19:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the best backend for your iOS App can be a challenge. The options are robust and depend on a number of questions like--do you need a cloud service? Should you run your own server? Should you use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/">Cloudkit</a>, <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a>, or another option? We dig into these questions and the other things you should consider when looking into back-end and cloud services for your iOS app.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Untitled-design-3-1-1024x512.png"/>{.wp-image-1682 width="768" height="384"} :::</p><p>First, it's important to point out that cloud services aren't needed in every case when it comes to an iOS (or any mobile) app. So, what can you do without them? A lot, actually.</p><blockquote><p>So one thing to consider is - there's a lot you can get away with without even doing cloud services. The thing with an iOS app is you can store your data in something like iCloud or in a lot of cases people really don't need the cloud to store their data. They can just store it on their phone itself. <strong><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/ffcb9fc1">EmpowerApps.Show - Episode 8 - Cloud and Backend &gt; Services</a></strong></p></blockquote><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Untitled-design-4-1024x512.png"/>{.wp-image-1680 width="768" height="384"} :::</p><h2>Best Backend is No Backend?</h2><p>Is the best backend for your iOS app, no backend? In many cases, you don't need cloud services for storage as you can just use the phone itself. When you're building an app, you should consider whether you really need something stored in the cloud or are you able to use a manual mechanism to back up the data? If you can create a mechanism that saves the data into cloud storage as a file, it could save you a lot of time and money.</p><p>In cases where you are dealing with private or sensitive data, it's a good idea to stick with your phone. This is especially true when dealing with third-party apps like <a href="https://developer.twitter.com">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/">YouTube</a> or another API where you're not really storing data but storing in the third party's structure. You can use that API as your database.</p><p>As an example, in an app built for doctors and nurses to receive continuing education for their career, all the data was essentially stored using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata">Core Data</a> which is a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database abstraction layer. It was all stored locally because their time and budget didn't allow for anything else. There was a manual backup process put in place that would run and create a zip file of the data and save it on the device. If they needed to restore it, they could sort it in the cloud and restore it back to their phones.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":28320,"title":"Cloud and Backend Services For

For example, note-taking apps that are available on all Apple devices (phones, iPads, computers) use a combination of <a href="https://www.icloud.com">iCloud</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/">CloudKit</a> to store information on the back-end. When a user opens their notes on their Mac or their iPhone, they are all available and accessible because they are stored in the cloud.</p><p>If you've decided that you do need back-end storage--what are some things you should consider when choosing the right path? Let's take a look.</p><blockquote><p>One thing to consider is timeline and budget and specifically what is the purpose of this app? Is this just a simple MVP or is it more of a long-term app that needs to be well architected when I first starts off? <strong><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/ffcb9fc1">EmpowerApps.Show - Episode 8 - Cloud and Backend &gt; Services</a></strong></p></blockquote><h3>The Purpose of Your App: MVP Vs. Enterprise</h3><p>Take a look at the app you're designing. Is it an MVP or a more robust Enterprise app?</p><p>An MVP (Most Viable Product) is a simple app that is just proving it's something your customers will actually want. It's something you need to get out quickly and is most likely a bare-bones version of the basic features you think your customers will want.</p><p>Or, does the app need to be well-architected right from the beginning, like an Enterprise app for a Fortune 500 company? If you're going this route, you're going to want something that is more robust and customizable and it should be something you'll want to work with for the long-term.</p><p>If you're looking to get out an MVP, the best backend for your iOS app is something that's simple, easy, and cheap and will just get the job done. It should be something that can be easily tested by your audience so you can see if it works with the needs of your users.</p><p>You'll also want to make sure you have some healthy abstraction with your API communication when you are writing your Swift of Objective-C code to talk to the back-end. That way, you will be able to pivot easily if you decide to use a different service at a later date and your users won't see anything different on the front end.</p><h3>Supported Devices</h3><p>Are you only supporting Apple devices? Are you also going to support the web? Are going to support Android? Are going to support Windows and Linux desktops? Are you going to support the internet of things? These are all questions to consider when deciding what back-end services to use.</p><p>If you're only supporting Apple devices, you may want to consider <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/">CloudKit</a>, an option we'll discuss in more detail below.</p><h3>Complex Vs. Simple Queries</h3><p>Some tasks, like relational data, are best performed through some sort of SQL database. However others might work better with a document storage type database. Most importantly, you should consider whether you need to aggregate your data or whether you need to create filters. In other words, do you need to view your data in a lot of different ways to combine your data set.</p><p>Conversely many simple document-based cloud storage options are cheaper. Therefore, if you're willing to offload a lot of the complexity of a good query over to the device like your iPhone document-based storage like <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a> might be a good option. Additionaly, you could consider caching your complex data for later rather than querying the data each time. Remember, a simple query would need to lookup data with a particular ID only.</p><p>You need to ask yourself if you're willing to offload a lot of the complexity of a good query over to the device like your iPhone, or is it more important to have that information on the server. The best backend for your iOS app might not be the easiest to query but the cheapest and easiest to maintain.</p><h3>Outside Communication</h3><p>Besides storage, you should also ask yourself if you will need any outside communication or outside scheduled jobs. This may occur if the user does something that creates data and then you need to be able to access that data even if they have their phone off such as email newsletter, shipping orders.</p><h3>The Expertise of Your Team</h3><p>This is a big factor because if their expertise is.net, you're probably better off using a Windows back end with an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx">SQL Server</a> and C#. If you're already getting a decent price on Azure, for instance, use it because that's what your team is an expert in. If your team is well versed in Swift, you may want to consider <a href="http://vapor.codes/">Vapor</a> for your backend. Check out <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2019/03/19/vapor-swift-backend-review/">our review of Vapor here for more details.</a></p><h3>User Interface (UI)</h3><p>We also recommend doing some user-focused design to come up with the kind of data that your users will need. Afterwards, work your way back towards how you would need to store that. For instance, you can start by building out the UI of the app and essentially fake the data to make sure that data is what the customers want and then go back from there. Get your UI taken care of because that's the thing the users are going to see.</p><p>These factors, plus the budget you're working with and the time you have to spend are all factors to consider when thinking about back-end storage.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":28320,"title":"Cloud and Backend Services For Apps with Erik

If you feel you need back-end support, you'll need to decide the best option for your app and your user. Here are some options to consider.</p><blockquote><p>...Some of the advantages of hosting your own is the fact that you can customize everything down to the minutiae, I mean you basically have a whole machine that you can work with that is also the disadvantage because the burden is on you to make sure everything is set up correctly wear as a lot of these other services. They pretty much can take care of everything. All you need to do is write your app code and get your database setup. <strong><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/ffcb9fc1">EmpowerApps.Show - Episode 8 - Cloud and Backend &gt; Services</a></strong></p></blockquote><h3>Hosting a Server For Your Backend</h3><p>The most customizable and robust option is just to host your own server. You can buy your own server and host it at a site with a virtual machine like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">AWS EC2</a>, <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=97e09acbd5d304d87dadef749491d245e71c74e7">Linode</a> or <a href="https://m.do.co/c/255904441a32">DigitalOcean</a>. <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=97e09acbd5d304d87dadef749491d245e71c74e7">Linode</a> is an affordable option at $5/month. However, you may not want a complete server both due to the cost but also the need for maintenance.</p><p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> is owned by Google but is open source and even AWS, Linode and Digital Ocean also host Kubernetes instances. This is a popular option for good reason, especially in the dev-op space.</p><p>If you're starting from scratch and want something to play with, Heroku is a great option. Their free tier which includes a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database is plenty to start with.</p><p>Speaking of PostgreSQL, you'll need to set up your own database, as well as other server software. Here are some specific options to consider:</p><h4>Databases</h4><ul><li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a></li><li><a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a></li><li><a href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a></li><li><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a></li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx">SQL Server</a></li></ul><p>You'll need something to server content whether it's images, JSON, or HTML:</p><h4>Server Software</h4><ul><li><a href="https://www.iis.net/">IIS</a></li><li><a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a></li><li><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a></li></ul><p>Also consider some other services such as:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"><strong>Cloudflare</strong></a> for monitoring, caching and CDN</li><li><a href="https://newrelic.com/"><strong>New Relic</strong></a> for monitoring and security</li><li><a href="http://supervisord.org/"><strong>Supervisor</strong></a> for services</li></ul><p>If you're working with a simple MVP or releasing only for Apple, we would not recommend hosting your own. If you have simple needs go with the simplest solution and then plan on scaling out from there according to the growth of your own needs.</p><h3>CloudKit as Your Backend</h3><p>One really affordable option worth exploring in more detail is Apple's back-end storage system, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/">CloudKit</a>. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/">CloudKit</a> is fairly simple to use if you're sticking with iOS. It comes with push notifications and is completely native to Apple. If you're running a Mac app or an iPad app or using an Apple Watch or Apple TV, it's really easy to use. It also includes a JavaScript component for the web. It is an easy yes is if you're just going to target Apple devices. When using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/">CloudKit</a>, you would be fine offloading some stuff onto the iPhone itself if the data isn't too complex.</p><p>If you absolutely need to run outside backups or outside cron jobs and can't do it on an iPhone or an iPad, then you might want to consider another option.</p><h3>Firebase as Your Backend</h3><p>Another popular option is <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a>. <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a> is the most popular mobile back-end as a service not only because of price but also because it's available on a plethora of devices. But beware, on the surface, it seems really appealing but we would hesitate when recommending it for projects that might scale. If you want to learn how to do real-time database integration in a web browser and you don't want to introduce apps where you have to create a lot of extra code in order to access data, <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a> is a great way to go about it.</p><p>But, while it is popular, after some research it appears that not a lot of enterprise-grade companies are relying on it. We recommend using it for very very simple situations where you have data that is not going to change in structure over time, data that's generally flat, and when you don't have to do lots of complex queries. Really study the limitations before you jump into it as it may not be a good fit for what you are looking for.</p><p>::: {.iframe} ::: {#embed-app episodes="[{"id":28320,"title":"Cloud and Backend

The best backend for your iOS app needs to be something that's rock solid and stable and gets a lot of support, just check out what the big guys are doing. You can be sure that the companies with a lot of money to spend will have taken the time to research and vet these solutions so you can consider anything they are using, a little bit safer than an under-researched option.</p><p>Typically they'll go with one of the big three: AWS, Azure, IBM. Or, they'll decide to host their own.</p><p>Whatever you choose, remember, if you need to pivot, do it early. Don't do it when it's too late. If you feel like your data isn't a good fit for whatever you end up, make the change as quickly as you can because you're not going to want to be burnt out by constantly trying to get your data to fit in particular space.</p><p>Want even MORE info?

For instance, for Swift developers, <a href="https://vapor.codes">Vapor</a> has become an increasingly apt choice. Therefore, I decided to <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/vapor-heroku-ubuntu-setup-deploy/?utm_medium=web&utm_source=learning-swift">deep dive</a> into <a href="https://vapor.codes">Vapor</a> and whether it is really a viable choice.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/jared-murray-974070-unsplash-e1552938209336-1024x512.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-1590}</p><h2>A Plethora Of Choices</h2><p>Looking at the landscape of back end choices can be rather confusing. In the end, <strong>it really depends on team's skillset</strong>. For instance, if you're using JavaScript to build your web and mobile applications, Node.JS makes sense. On the other hand, if you are .Net developer team, Web API makes sense. Moreover, if you are particularly skilled with PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, etc..., you should stay within your comfort zone.</p><p>However for single developers and developer teams (such as me) which focus on Apple products, there isn't a dedicated framework for server-side applications. Therefore, the closest option is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/">CloudKit</a>, which is good for data storage but lacks options such as:</p><ul><li>No support outside of web and Apple devices</li><li>No support for complete backups</li><li>Locked into the CloudKit data model for relationships</li><li>No Cron Jobs</li></ul><p>However there are other options to remain developing in Swift on server.</p><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/wordmark-horizontal-1024x271.png"/><p>{.wp-image-1553}</p><h2>Vapor - Swift for the Server</h2><p>Since Swift was open sourced in late 2015, compatibility for other operating system has been added. One of the first teams to move Swift to the server was the Vapor team. Since the release of version 3.0 in May 2018, interest has grown.</p><p>In this article, I will review Vapor and cover:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#getting-started">Ease of Installation and Deployment</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#developing">Developing For Vapor</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#database-support">Database Support</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#event-driven">Event-Driven Async API</a></strong></li></ul><p>Therefore, let's begin by talking about how easy it is to get started.</p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/getting-things-setup.jpg?fit=1024%2C512&ssl=1"/><p>{.wp-image-1555}</p><h2>Getting Started with Vapor {#getting-started}</h2><p><a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/vapor-heroku-ubuntu-setup-deploy/?utm_medium=web&utm_source=learning-swift">In this article I recently published, I showed how to get started by installing Vapor on your Mac and Ubuntu as well as services like Heroku.</a> In short, <strong>I found the process to be pretty simple and effective</strong>. That is to say, it is no more complex then any other web framework.</p><p>For instance, on the Mac, developers can use <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, which is fairly common, to tap the Vapor repo and install. After you have access to the Vapor CLI tool which includes a subcommand for setting up your Heroku application with the Vapor buildpack.</p><p>Likewise on Ubuntu, you add the apt repo for Vapor and install via <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html.en">the</a> <em><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html.en">apt</a></em> <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html.en">command</a>. Having done that, you can easily use a combination of a process monitor and an http server to proxy the server.</p><p>If you are interested in more details on this process, <strong>check out <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/vapor-heroku-ubuntu-setup-deploy/?utm_medium=web&utm_source=learning-swift">this article which deep dives into Vapor and setting up for macOS, Heroku, and Ubuntu.</a></strong></p><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/developer-tools-1024x512.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-1557}</p><h2>Developing with Vapor {#developing}</h2><p>Having installed Vapor, the next part of the procedure is developing the app. As a result, the IDE is very important.</p><h3>Developer Tools with Vapor</h3><p>In spite of <a href="#Xcode-issues">its issues</a>, we can still develop in Swift with Xcode. However, since there are command line tools to build a Swift application and a developer could choose their own tool. At the present time, the real limitation is that Swift in general is only supported on macOS and Ubuntu. That is to say <strong>there is no support for other Linux or Unix operating systems as well as no support for Windows.</strong> However, the community is certainly moving forward with extending support in those areas. Similarly, the community has provided plenty of packages.</p><h3>Third Party Support for Vapor</h3><p>Node.js has npm, Ruby has gems, C# has Nuget, Python has pip and Swift has the <a href="https://swift.org/package-manager/">Swift Package Manager</a>. Generally speaking, the Swift Package Manager or SPM has been slowly adapted as the premier dependency manager. In the long run while Cocoapods and Carthage still reign in the area of iOS development, <strong>it is inevitable that SPM will dominate in the future</strong>. Having discussed outside support for Vapor, let's discuss what Vapor (and its package support currently).</p><h3>Database Support and Fluent ORM {#database-support}</h3><p>My experience working with various ORMs are varied. Being that I've worked with Entity Framework in C# and Sequelize for Node.Js, I have some experience. Having said that, <strong>what makes these work so well is the ability to use lambdas and implement many functional programming paradigms.</strong> As a result, since Swift has that ability, using the Fluent ORM is fairly easy to learn.</p><p>Equally important is its support of various database software. As of now, there is support for:</p><ul><li>MySQL</li><li>MariaDB</li><li>MongoDB</li><li>PostgreSQL</li><li>SQLite</li></ul><p>As can be seen, there is sufficient database support. Not to mention, but its support for those databases is fairly deep.</p><h4>Deep Database Support</h4><p>For instance, I ran into an issue where I was searching for objects by title - a fairly simple keyword search for a REST API list operation. However, what I didn't realize was that many titles have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic"><em>diacritcs</em></a>, specifically accents. In other words if a user searches for something with an <em>e</em> if a title has an <em>é</em>, that result won't show up. In spite of this, there is code in PostgreSQL to <em>unaccent</em> a string, such as there is a way to do lower or upper case transformation. Having adding the necessary functions, I am able to call the function with Fluent's API:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> columnId = <span class="type">PostgreSQLColumnIdentifier</span>.<span class="call">column</span>(<span class="string">"Game"</span>, <span class="string">"title"</span>)
<span class="keyword">let</span> column = <span class="type">PostgreSQLExpression</span>.<span class="call">column</span>(columnId)
<span class="keyword">let</span> arg = <span class="type">GenericSQLFunctionArgument</span>&lt;<span class="type">PostgreSQLExpression</span>&gt;.<span class="call">expression</span>(column)
<span class="keyword">let</span> args : [<span class="type">GenericSQLFunctionArgument</span>&lt;<span class="type">PostgreSQLExpression</span>&gt;] = [arg]
<span class="keyword">let</span> expression = <span class="type">PostgreSQLExpression</span>.<span class="call">function</span>(<span class="string">"unaccent"</span>, args)
</code></pre><p>As shown above, this may not be ideal, but it works. In addition, you always have access to lower level, direct SQL code using the Database Kit API. However what truly makes Fluent ORM so robust is the use of SwiftNIO async API.</p><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/futures-and-promises-1024x512.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-1559}</p><h3>The <em>Future</em> of Programming {#event-driven}</h3><p>In short, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-nio">SwiftNIO</a>, the event-driven network application framework started by Apple, provides a set of types for handling callback-based asynchronous APIs such as database queries.</p><p>[]{#Xcode-issues}</p><p>In addition, Vapor provides a set of functionality which make complex queries accessible in code. That is to say <strong>SwiftNIO and Vapor provides futures and promises as well as and API for dealing with multiple objects such as transformations</strong>. Despite this, <strong>the most significant friction I have found was the combination of Xcode and Swift compiler delivering misleading error message.</strong> At present, this is very common complaint with Swift and Xcode in general but it is certainly an issue worth mentioning. Likewise, I used the same async API when making various HTTP calls and found it very reliable.</p><h3>The REST of the API</h3><p>As opposed to URLRequest, <strong>the HTTP API is promise/future friendly</strong> which is nice improvement. However, any async call in Swift can easily be made friendly. In addition to the Fluent ORM, HTTP, and Async APIs, I did make use of the Auth, Crypto, and Routing APIs. In short, all worked flawlessly.</p><p>For instance, serialization from JSON or Multipart encoded data works without much needed implementation. That is to say, if you are implementing a type which correctly implements Codable then there should not be much extra effort in creating a robust REST API. However, if you do need to customize your type to use Codable, I highly recommend my post on improving how you decode JSON.</p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/swift-vapor-choice.jpg?fit=1024%2C512&ssl=1"/><p>{.wp-image-1561}</p><h2>Vaporware or Swift-ly Switch?</h2><p>To sum up, <strong>Vapor is already a healthy framework to start any new server-side application</strong>. However, I would never recommend anyone rewrite their whole application in this.</p><p>Overall, <strong>if you are already Swift team and you are looking to move some if not all your code to a new framework, I'd highly recommend taking a look Vapor as your first choice.</strong> Not to mention, if you are using a web framework that is becoming a burden and <strong>enjoy the versatility of Swift, going with Vapor would be good fit</strong>. (Besides that, the only caveat I'd make is that if you are building for the enterprise I would look into <a href="https://www.kitura.io">Kitura</a>, the IBM team has plenty of experience in that space and <a href="https://www.kitura.io">Kitura</a> seems more focused in those regards.)</p><p>On the other hand, if you are using a web framework which has performed well for your team and most of your development is not in Swift, then switching to Vapor does not make sense. Lastly, I just wanted to point out, that Vapor works well outside of an Apple client application. For example, <strong><a href="https://redmushroom.club?utm_medium=web&utm_source=learning-swift">I successfully built a web application using VueJs and Axios</a> and had no difficulty when it came to server-client communication.</strong> If you are interested in getting started, <a href="http://eepurl.com/gk8mp5">subscribe to this newsletter</a>, to get started guide as well as updates on how to develop a robust application with Vapor.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/vapor-heroku-ubuntu-setup-deploy</guid><title>vapor-heroku-ubuntu-setup-deploy</title><description>Vapor is a really great choice and fairly easy to work with.

According to the Vapor docs, <strong>you need Xcode 9.3 or greater</strong>. However for this tutorial, I used the latest version of macOS and Xcode at the time of writing:</p><ul><li>macOS <strong>Mojave 10.14.3</strong></li><li>Xcode <strong>10.1</strong></li></ul><h3>Prerequisites For Vapor</h3><p>I also have installed <strong><a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a></strong>. To install Homebrew, open your terminal application and type:</p><pre><code>/usr/bin/ruby -e <span class="string">"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</span>`
</code></pre><p>For more details you can go to <strong><a href="https://brew.sh/">the official Homebrew home page</a></strong>.</p><h3>Installing Vapor</h3><p>Once you have Homebrew installed we can go ahead and install <strong>Vapor</strong> on your Mac. Before we proceed, we'll need to add the Vapor repository to Homebrew.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yYCxa6ev1Ng :::</p><ol><li>Firstly, <strong>add the Vapor repository</strong> using the <code>tap</code> command:</li></ol><pre><code>brew tap vapor/tap
</code></pre><ol start="2"><li>Next, <strong>install the Vapor toolkit</strong>:</li></ol><pre><code>brew install vapor/tap/vapor
</code></pre><p>As a result of installing the Vapor toolkit, <strong>we'll have access to the Vapor CLI tool</strong>. Therefore, you can get access to the list of commands available by typing:</p><pre><code>vapor --help
</code></pre><p>For example, <strong>with the Vapor CLI tool</strong>, you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Build</strong> the application</li><li><strong>Run</strong> the application</li><li>setup for <strong>Heroku</strong> deployment later</li><li>Create the <strong>Xcode</strong> project and of course...</li><li>Create the <strong>new</strong> Swift package</li></ul><h3>Creating Your First Vapor Project</h3><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iZqHmFnisXQ :::</p><p>Therefore, <strong>we can create the Switch package which will contain the dependencies needed to run our server application</strong> with the command:</p><pre><code>vapor new app-collection
</code></pre><p>Additionally, <strong>we can create an Xcode project</strong> from our Vapor application Swift package by typing:</p><pre><code>vapor xcode
</code></pre><p>As a result, we can open the newly created Xcode project.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/macos_xcode_switch_target.jpg" alt="Switching the target to <em>Run</em>"/><p>{.wp-image-514}</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/macos_xcode_run.jpg" alt="Building and running the <em>Run</em> target"/><p>{.wp-image-515}</p><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZKP2MiFaLQ :::</p><p>After that, switch the target in the top left to <em>Run</em> and press the <em>play button</em> to run the application. Consequently, you should see a log message at the bottom stating that a http server is started at port 8080.</p><p>As a result, go to the terminal and run the command:</p><pre><code>curl http://localhost:<span class="number">8080</span>/hello
</code></pre><p>Therefore, you should receive the message:</p><pre><code><span class="type">Hello</span>, world!%
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bRXTT8K-lP8 :::</p><p>In conclusion, we've successfully used the provided Vapor templates with the <em>new</em> and <em>xcode</em> commands to create the Swift package and build the application in Xcode. However the application only used SQLite for our database storage. Instead, let's switch to using a more common database: PostgreSQL.</p><h2>Setting Up For PostgreSQL {#macos-postgresql}</h2><p>PostgreSQL has been my favorite relational SQL based database server. As a result, we are going to look at converting the current Vapor project to use PostgreSQL rather than the default SQLite.</p><p>Therefore, make sure you already have PostgreSQL installed. Consequently, if you don't you can use Homebrew to install PostgreSQL with the following command:</p><pre><code>brew install postgresql
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeLHTQrZXNI :::</p><p>Further, to run the server from the Terminal:</p><pre><code>pg_ctl -<span class="type">D</span> /usr/local/<span class="keyword">var</span>/postgres start
</code></pre><p>Similarly, you can stop the server from the Terminal with:</p><pre><code>pg_ctl -<span class="type">D</span> /usr/local/<span class="keyword">var</span>/postgres stop
</code></pre><p>On the other hand, if you wish to run PostgreSQL as background service with launchd you can use the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services"><code>brew services</code></a> command:</p><pre><code>brew services start postgresql
</code></pre><p>Most importantly, once PostgreSQL is started, we'll need to add the database and user for our application to use.</p><h3>Setup Database and User</h3><p>As a result of switching the PostgreSQL, we'll need to add the user and database our Vapor application will use. Therefore, let's run the PostgreSQL terminal-based front-end <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/index.html"><code>psql</code></a> by going to the Terminal and typing:</p><pre><code>psql -d postgres
</code></pre><p>After that, at the <code>psql</code> prompt, create the database with:</p><pre><code>create database app_collection;
</code></pre><p>Likewise, we need to create a user. To clarify, we are creating a user with no password by typing:</p><pre><code>create user app_collection;
</code></pre><p>Subsequently grant that user the privileges it needs with:</p><pre><code>grant all privileges on database app_collection to app_collection;
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmKSy71PxWM :::</p><p>As a result, our database should be ready for access. However, we'll need to update the code and specifically the Swift package to use PostgreSQL.</p><h3>Updating the Code For PostgreSQL</h3><h4>Update Package.swift with PostgreSQL</h4><p>In order to use PostgreSQL in our backend application, we'll need to update the Package.swift file to use PostgreSQL as opposed to SQLite.</p><p>Therefore, open the Package.swift and update <code>dependencies</code> by changing the line from:</p><pre><code>.<span class="call">package</span>(url: <span class="string">"https://github.com/vapor/fluent-sqlite.git"</span>, from: <span class="string">"3.0.0"</span>)
</code></pre><p>to the line:</p><pre><code>.<span class="call">package</span>(url: <span class="string">"https://github.com/vapor/fluent-postgresql.git"</span>, from: <span class="string">"1.0.0"</span>)
</code></pre><p>To clarify, we'll be using <a href="https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/fluent/getting-started/">Fluent</a>, Vapor's ORM Framework, along with PostgreSQL. In other words, we are swapping the Fluent driver for SQLite with the one for PostgreSQL. Likewise, if you can read more details on the different drivers and how their setup works in Fluent's documentation.</p><p>Consequently, we need to also update the <em>App targets</em> to use the new <em>FluentPostgreSQL</em> dependency. Therefore change the line:</p><pre><code>  .<span class="call">target</span>(name: <span class="string">"App"</span>, dependencies: [<span class="string">"FluentSQLite"</span>, <span class="string">"Vapor"</span>]),
</code></pre><p>to the line:</p><pre><code>  .<span class="call">target</span>(name: <span class="string">"App"</span>, dependencies: [<span class="string">"FluentPostgreSQL"</span>, <span class="string">"Vapor"</span>]),
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Z1HxSMVWU :::</p><p>In addition to updating the <em>Package.swift</em> file, we need to actually update our Xcode project to use the new dependencies.</p><h4>Update Packages</h4><p>Therefore, in order to fetch and update the package with the new dependencies and update the Xcode project file, we can run the <em>xcode</em> command again with:</p><pre><code>vapor xcode
</code></pre><p>As a result, vapor has fetched the Fluent PostgreSQL driver and updated the Xcode project. Therefore, we can move forward by updating the code.</p><h4>Update the Code</h4><p>Consequently, open the update Xcode project. Since we have removed the Fluent SQLite driver, we should no longer be able to build the project. As a result we need update our models to use PostgreSQL as well as the Provider, Database, and Migration used in our configuration. Therefore, open the <em>configure.swift</em>.</p><p>Firstly, let's update the import at the top of the file from:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">import</span> FluentSQLite
</code></pre><p>to:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">import</span> FluentPostgreSQL
</code></pre><p>Secondly, update the provider by updating the line:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">try</span> services.<span class="call">register</span>(<span class="type">FluentSQLiteProvider</span>())
</code></pre><p>to</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">try</span> services.<span class="call">register</span>(<span class="type">FluentPostgreSQLProvider</span>())
</code></pre><p>Further, update the database used by changing the line from:</p><pre><code><span class="comment">// Configure a SQLite database</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> sqlite = <span class="keyword">try</span> <span class="type">SQLiteDatabase</span>(storage: .<span class="dotAccess">memory</span>)

<span class="comment">// Register the configured SQLite database to the database config.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> databases = <span class="type">DatabasesConfig</span>()
databases.<span class="call">add</span>(database: sqlite, as: .<span class="dotAccess">sqlite</span>)
services.<span class="call">register</span>(databases)
</code></pre><p>to:</p><pre><code><span class="comment">// Configure a PostgreSQL database</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> postgreSQLConfig = <span class="type">PostgreSQLDatabaseConfig</span>(hostname: <span class="string">"localhost"</span>, username: <span class="string">"app_collection"</span>)
<span class="keyword">let</span> postgreSQL = <span class="type">PostgreSQLDatabase</span>(config: postgreSQLConfig)

<span class="comment">// Register the configured PostreSQL database to the database config.</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> databases = <span class="type">DatabasesConfig</span>()
databases.<span class="call">add</span>(database: postgreSQL, as: .<span class="dotAccess">psql</span>)
services.<span class="call">register</span>(databases)
</code></pre><p>In other words, we are replacing the memory based SQLite database with the PostgreSQL local database configured with the user name <em>app</em>collection*.</p><p>To clarify, the <a href="https://api.vapor.codes/postgresql/latest/PostgreSQL/Structs/PostgreSQLDatabaseConfig.html#/s:10PostgreSQL0A17SQLDatabaseConfigVACSS8hostname_Si4portSS8usernameSSSg8databaseAG8passwordAA0A13SQLConnectionC09TransportD0V9transporttcfc"><code>PostgreSQLDatabaseConfig</code> initializer</a> can multiple parameters in this case we are using the default port number and the default database name which matches with user name, in this case <em>app</em>collection*.</p><p>Lastly, in the <em>configuration.swift</em>, update the migration for the</p><p><code>Todo</code> model. To clarify, <a href="https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/fluent/migrations/">migrations</a> are used to create and update the tables and relationships used by Fluent. Therefore, in this case we just need to change the parameter in this line:</p><pre><code>migrations.<span class="call">add</span>(model: <span class="type">Todo</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, database: .<span class="dotAccess">sqlite</span>)
</code></pre><p>to this line:</p><pre><code>migrations.<span class="call">add</span>(model: <span class="type">Todo</span>.<span class="keyword">self</span>, database: .<span class="dotAccess">psql</span>)
</code></pre><p>In the same vein, we need to change the subclasses used by our model by opening <em>Todo.swift</em>. After that change the import statement at the top again and then update model subclass from:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">final class</span> Todo: <span class="type">SQLiteModel</span> {
</code></pre><p>to</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">final class</span> Todo: <span class="type">PostgreSQLModel</span> {
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EL98HVIzV9M :::</p><p>As a result, we can go ahead and run the Vapor application.</p><h3>Run the Code</h3><p>To sum up, now that have setup the PostgreSQL database on our machine, update the Swift package dependencies, and updated the code accordingly; we can build and run the Vapor application. Therefore, in Xcode, run the <em>Run</em> target again. After that, let's go to the Terminal app to test the application. For example we can run again:</p><pre><code>curl http://localhost:<span class="number">8080</span>/hello
</code></pre><p>However, we can also add a <code>Todo</code> item by running:</p><pre><code>curl -<span class="type">X POST</span> -<span class="type">H</span> <span class="string">"Content-Type: application/json"</span> -d '{<span class="string">"title"</span>: <span class="string">"example"</span>}' http://localhost:<span class="number">8080</span>/todos
</code></pre><p>Consequently, we can verify the <code>Todo</code> item was added by calling:</p><pre><code>curl http://localhost:<span class="number">8080</span>/todos
</code></pre><p>As a result, we get the JSON response:</p><pre><code>[{<span class="string">"id"</span>:<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="string">"title"</span>:<span class="string">"example"</span>}]
</code></pre><p>Subsequently, let's deploy this to the cloud. Firstly, we'll look into Heroku.</p><h2>Deploying Vapor to Heroku {#heroku-vapor}</h2><p>In addition to setting up our application for PostgreSQL, we will move forward with deploying it Heroku. Above all, Heroku offers the easiest way to get up and running. In addition, it offers enough plugins and services on its free tier that we can simply get started. Therefore, let's begin by setting up our project for Heroku.</p><h3>Preparing Vapor Package For Heroku</h3><p>Importantly, make sure you have an account setup at Heroku. After that, go to the Terminal again, and in the project directory, we can simply run the command:</p><pre><code>vapor heroku <span class="keyword">init</span>
</code></pre><p>As a result, of running the command, we have created a Heroku application and added :</p><ul><li>Created a Heroku application in your account then</li><li>Vapor buildpack for Heroku deployment</li><li>git remote for Heroku</li><li>Procfile needed for Heroku to run the application</li></ul><p>The Procfile, which you read about in <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile">the Procfile documentation</a>, contains the following line:</p><pre><code>web: <span class="type">Run</span> serve --env production --port $PORT --hostname <span class="number">0.0.0.0</span>
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8piDsDi6PNo :::</p><p>Moreover when you run the command, you do not need the supply any customizations. However we will need to add PostgreSQL to our Heroku application.</p><h3>Adding PostgreSQL To Heroku Instance</h3><p>Similarly, as we have setup the Vapor application in Heroku via the Terminal, we need to add PostgreSQL to our application. Therefore, we can add the Heroku repo and install the <em>heroku</em> command with Homebrew by running:</p><pre><code>brew tap heroku/brew &amp;&amp; brew install heroku
</code></pre><p>Consequently, we can add PostgreSQL by running the command:</p><pre><code>heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
</code></pre><p>As a result of running this command, we've added a <a href="https://www.heroku.com/postgres#heroku-postgres-hobby">free <em>hobby</em> level instance of PostgreSQL</a> to our application.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rprznYi-kKQ :::</p><p>Consequently, Heroku will add an environment variable for the database called <code>DATABASE_URL</code>. Therefore, we'll need to update our code to use this.</p><h3>Update Code For Heroku PostgreSQL</h3><p>Since we have added PostgreSQL to our Heroku instance, we need to update our code to use the environment the variable for the new database url,</p><p><code>DATABASE_URL</code>. Therefore, open the <em>configure.swift</em>. After that, change the lines where we setup the database from:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> postgreSQLConfig = <span class="type">PostgreSQLDatabaseConfig</span>(hostname: <span class="string">"localhost"</span>, username: <span class="string">"app_collection"</span>)
</code></pre><p>to:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> postgreSQLConfig : <span class="type">PostgreSQLDatabaseConfig</span>
  
<span class="keyword">if let</span> url = <span class="type">Environment</span>.<span class="call">get</span>(<span class="string">"DATABASE_URL"</span>) {
  postgreSQLConfig = <span class="type">PostgreSQLDatabaseConfig</span>(url: url)!
} <span class="keyword">else</span> {
  postgreSQLConfig = <span class="type">PostgreSQLDatabaseConfig</span>(hostname: <span class="string">"localhost"</span>, username: <span class="string">"app_collection"</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7VILggBt0Q :::</p><p>As a result of changing the code, we will be checking if there is an environment variable called <code>DATABASE_URL</code>. In other words, we are using the static method<a href="https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/getting-started/services/#environment"><code>Environment.get(_:)</code></a> to fetch the string value if it exists. Secondly, if the variable doesn't exist we assume this is being run locally and it uses the default settings. To clarify, we are using an unconditional unwrapping since we'd rather it trigger a runtime error than attempt to use the default settings. Lastly, let's move forward with deploying our application.</p><h3>Deploying Vapor Package to Heroku</h3><p>Similarly, we can deploy the application to Heroku in the terminal with one of two commands. Firstly, you can push directly with git using the command:</p><pre><code>git push heroku master
</code></pre><p>Secondly, you can push with the Vapor CLI command:</p><pre><code>vapor heroku push
</code></pre><p>In short, either command will:</p><ul><li>Firstly, push your code to the Heroku</li><li>Secondly, build the Application</li><li>Lastly, run the application (based on the command in the Procfile)</li></ul><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=J0-wLRCarzc :::</p><p>Therefore, if our application instance is called <em>damp-spire-56788</em> , we should be call our application with <code>curl</code>:</p><pre><code>&gt; curl http://damp-spire-<span class="number">56788</span>.<span class="property">herokuapp</span>.<span class="property">com</span>/hello
<span class="type">Hello</span>, world!%
&gt; curl -<span class="type">X POST</span> -<span class="type">H</span> <span class="string">"Content-Type: application/json"</span> -d '{<span class="string">"title"</span>: <span class="string">"example"</span>}' http://damp-spire-<span class="number">56788</span>.<span class="property">herokuapp</span>.<span class="property">com</span>/<span class="call">todos</span>
{<span class="string">"id"</span>:<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="string">"title"</span>:<span class="string">"example"</span>}%
&gt; curl http://damp-spire-<span class="number">56788</span>.<span class="property">herokuapp</span>.<span class="property">com</span>/todos
[{<span class="string">"id"</span>:<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="string">"title"</span>:<span class="string">"example"</span>}]%
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a0IJUTOJafo :::</p><p>In short, we can setup our app for Heroku by</p><ul><li>Firstly, using the Vapor CLI to setup the instance, build pack, Procfile, and git remote</li><li>Secondly, using setting up a PostgreSQL instance in Heroku</li><li>After that, updating the code to use the environment variable for the database url to access the Heroku PostgreSQL instance</li><li>Lastly, pushing the code to Heroku and testing the application</li></ul><p>Similarly, now that we know how to deploy to Heroku, let's look at what we need to do to setup our own Ubuntu server for hosting our Vapor application.</p><h2>Setting Up Vapor For Ubuntu {#ubuntu-vapor}</h2><p>In the same way, I showed how to setup our Vapor application for Heroku; we are going to look at what is needed to setup an Ubuntu server. In this case, we are using the latest LTS version of Ubuntu which is Bionic Beaver 18.04. However, according to the <a href="https://docs.vapor.codes/3.0/install/ubuntu/">documentation</a>, Vapor does support version 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) and up including 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish).</p><h3>Installing Prerequisites</h3><p>With a new server setup, we need to install several package. However, first we need add Vapor's APT repo. Therefore, on the server (as root), run the following command:</p><pre><code>eval <span class="string">"$(curl -sL https://apt.vapor.sh)"</span>
</code></pre><p>After that, we can proceed with installing the software we'll be using to setup our server:</p><ul><li><strong>git</strong> - for fetching the code of our application</li><li><strong>nginx</strong> - our http server</li><li><strong>postgresql</strong> - our database server</li><li><strong>supervisor</strong> - which is used to monitor and execute the application</li><li><strong>swift</strong> and <strong>vapor</strong> - which is used to build and run the application</li></ul><p>Therefore, we can install the application with:</p><pre><code>apt install git supervisor postgresql swift vapor nginx
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul4hL9vP06g :::</p><h3>Setting Up the PostgreSQL Database</h3><p>Similarly to how we use the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> on Heroku, we are going to setup environment variables in Ubuntu.</p><h4>Updating the Code {#ubuntu-code}</h4><p>Therefore, open up Xcode and in our project go back to</p><p><code>configure.swift</code>. After that, between the <code>import</code> statements but before the <code>configure</code> function add a struct to store the defaults for PostgreSQL:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">public struct</span> PostgresDefaults {
  <span class="keyword">public static let</span> hostname = <span class="string">"localhost"</span>
  <span class="keyword">public static let</span> username = <span class="string">"app_collection"</span>
  <span class="keyword">public static let</span> port = <span class="number">5432</span>
}
</code></pre><p>To clarify, this struct stores the default host name, user name, and port, we use for PostgreSQL configuration</p><p>Moreover change the line in the else statement from:</p><pre><code>postgreSQLConfig = <span class="type">PostgreSQLDatabaseConfig</span>(hostname: <span class="string">"localhost"</span>, username: <span class="string">"app_collection"</span>)
</code></pre><p>to:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> hostname = <span class="type">Environment</span>.<span class="call">get</span>(<span class="string">"DATABASE_HOSTNAME"</span>) ?? <span class="type">PostgresDefaults</span>.<span class="property">hostname</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> username = <span class="type">Environment</span>.<span class="call">get</span>(<span class="string">"DATABASE_USERNAME"</span>) ?? <span class="type">PostgresDefaults</span>.<span class="property">username</span>
<span class="keyword">let</span> database = <span class="type">Environment</span>.<span class="call">get</span>(<span class="string">"DATABASE_DATABASE"</span>)
<span class="keyword">let</span> password = <span class="type">Environment</span>.<span class="call">get</span>(<span class="string">"DATABASE_PASSWORD"</span>)

<span class="keyword">let</span> port : <span class="type">Int</span>

<span class="keyword">if let</span> portString = <span class="type">Environment</span>.<span class="call">get</span>(<span class="string">"DATABASE_PORT"</span>) {
  port = <span class="type">Int</span>(portString) ?? <span class="type">PostgresDefaults</span>.<span class="property">port</span>
} <span class="keyword">else</span> {
  port = <span class="type">PostgresDefaults</span>.<span class="property">port</span>
}

postgreSQLConfig = <span class="type">PostgreSQLDatabaseConfig</span>(hostname: hostname, port: port, username: username, database: database, password: password, transport: .<span class="dotAccess">cleartext</span>)
</code></pre><p>To sum up, this code fetches from the environment variables for the host name, user name, database, password, and port. Consequently, if any value is invalid or does not exist it falls back to the default setup in the <code>PostgresDefaults</code> struct or null and let's the</p><p><code>PostgreSQLDatabaseConfig</code> use its default value. Likewise, this code will still work on Heroku (with the <code>DATABASE_URL</code>) and on localhost with the defaults setup.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-embed_<em>wrapper} https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb3LNa</em>eADo :::</p><p>However, before we setup the environment variables for our application, we need to setup the database.</p><h4>Add Database and User</h4><p>Therefore, as root, sudo in as the <code>postgres</code> user and run <code>psql</code>:</p><pre><code>sudo -u postgres psql
</code></pre><p>After that, run the following sql statements:</p><pre><code>create database app_collection;
create user app_collection with encrypted password 'app_collection_pw';
grant all privileges on database app_collection to app_collection;
</code></pre><p>To clarify, we are creating:</p><ul><li>database named <em>app</em>collection*</li><li>user named <em>app</em>collection<em> with a password </em>app<em>collection</em>pw*</li><li>grant the user all privileges on the database, we've created</li></ul><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hY1gOcB4XbE :::</p><p>As a result of setting up the database, we can begin to setup <em>supervisor</em>.</p><h3>Setting Up Supervisor</h3><p>Since we are using supervisor, we are going to be setting up a Linux user to run the actual application.</p><h4>Adding a Linux User</h4><p>As root user again, run the following command:</p><pre><code>adduser app_collection
</code></pre><p>To clarify, we are setting up user called <code>app_collection</code> which does not need any other metadata (Full Name, Room Number, etc...). Therefore having setup the user, let's pull and build the code.</p><h4>Pulling Repo</h4><p>Having setup the user in Linux, go ahead and super user in as the new user:</p><pre><code>su -l app_collection
</code></pre><p>After that, as the new user, clone the repo:</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.<span class="property">com</span>/brightdigit/swift-vapor-app-collection-sample.<span class="property">git</span> app
</code></pre><p>Subsequently, go to the directory and build the application:</p><pre><code>cd app
vapor build
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RU3jJUe66uE :::</p><p>In short, we have cloned the code from our repo and built the application. As a result, we can move forward with configuring supervisor.</p><h4>Configuring Supervisor</h4><p>While our application will serve our Rest API and <em>nginx</em> will proxy that connection, <em>supervisor</em> will monitor and control the actual Vapor application process. Therefore, let's create a configuration for our Vapor application. In other words, as root, create a file here:</p><pre><code>/etc/supervisor/conf.<span class="property">d</span>/app_collection.<span class="property">conf</span>
</code></pre><p>After that, paste this text into the configuration file:</p><pre><code>[program:app_collection]
environment =
        <span class="type">DATABASE_PASSWORD</span>=<span class="string">"app_collection_pw"</span>,
command=vapor run --port=<span class="number">3000</span> --env=production
directory=/home/app_collection/app/
autorestart=<span class="keyword">true</span>
user=app_collection
stdout_logfile=/<span class="keyword">var</span>/log/supervisor/%(program_name)-stdout.<span class="property">log</span>
stderr_logfile=/<span class="keyword">var</span>/log/supervisor/%(program_name)-stderr.<span class="property">log</span>
</code></pre><p>To clarify:</p><ul><li>the name of this process will be <em>program:app</em>collection*</li><li>we setup an environment variable for the database password</li><li>the command is to run Vapor from our code's directory</li><li>auto restart if the app fails</li><li>run as our new user</li><li>lastly, we have setup a path for the application output and errors</li></ul><p>Subsequently, we can go ahead and update supervisor by with the following commands:</p><pre><code>supervisorctl reread
supervisorctl update
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-dCqEE3L0nk :::</p><p>After that, you can test if supervisor was successful by calling the application from port 3000:</p><pre><code>curl http://localhost:<span class="number">3000</span>/hello
</code></pre><p>In short, we've setup our Vapor application in supervisor to run on port 3000 with a database password setup as an environment variable. As a result, let's setup <em>nginx</em> to proxy our application.</p><h3>Setting Up Nginx</h3><p>For our http server, we'll be using <em>nginx</em>. Most importantly, we'll be setting up a host name for our application. Therefore, we are using the nginxconfig.io to setup the config files. Consequently, you can download <a href="https://nginxconfig.io/?0.domain=app_collection.local&0.redirect=false&0.https=false&0.php=false&0.proxy&0.proxy_pass=http:%2F%2Flocalhost:3000&0.root=false">the specific <em>nginx</em> configuration</a> we are using from <a href="https://nginxconfig.io/?0.domain=app_collection.local&0.redirect=false&0.https=false&0.php=false&0.proxy&0.proxy_pass=http:%2F%2Flocalhost:3000&0.root=false "specific nginx configuration for our example"">here</a>. In addition, feel free to change host name before downloading.</p><p>After that, unzip the file:</p><pre><code>unzip nginxconfig.<span class="property">io</span>-app_collection.<span class="property">local</span>.<span class="property">zip</span>
</code></pre><p>Firstly, we can, as root, move the files to their proper locations:</p><pre><code>mv nginx.<span class="property">conf</span> /etc/nginx/nginx.<span class="property">conf</span>
mv sites-available/app_collection.<span class="property">local</span>.<span class="property">conf</span> /etc/nginx/sites-available
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/app_collection.<span class="property">local</span>.<span class="property">conf</span> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
mv nginxconfig.<span class="property">io</span> /etc/nginx/
</code></pre><p>Secondly, now that we have moved the configuration files over, restart nginx:</p><pre><code>service nginx restart
</code></pre><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qUrDtoHI-zw :::</p><p>Most importantly, if you are using a <code>.local</code> host name, make sure to setup the host name on your network. That is to say, make sure the host name is accessible from your local development computer. For instance, on macOS or Linux, you would need to edit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file">the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file</a>). On the other hand, if this is to be a public host name, verify you have updated your dns accordingly.</p><p>After you have verified the dns or hosts file is updated, we can proceed if testing the application out:</p><pre><code>&gt; curl http://app_collection.<span class="property">local</span>/hello
<span class="type">Hello</span>, world!%
&gt; curl -<span class="type">X POST</span> -<span class="type">H</span> <span class="string">"Content-Type: application/json"</span> -d '{<span class="string">"title"</span>: <span class="string">"example"</span>}' http://app_collection.<span class="property">local</span>/<span class="call">todos</span>
{<span class="string">"id"</span>:<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="string">"title"</span>:<span class="string">"example"</span>}%
&gt; curl http://app_collection.<span class="property">local</span>/todos
[{<span class="string">"id"</span>:<span class="number">1</span>,<span class="string">"title"</span>:<span class="string">"example"</span>}]%
</code></pre><p>In short, we've successfully setup the application on an Ubuntu server.</p><p>::: {#mc<em>embed</em>signup} ::: {#mc<em>embed</em>signup_scroll}</p><h2>Want to Learn More?

For instance, for Swift developers, <a href="https://vapor.codes">Vapor</a> has become an increasingly apt choice. Therefore, I decided to <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/vapor-heroku-ubuntu-setup-deploy/?utm_medium=web&utm_source=learning-swift">deep dive</a> into <a href="https://vapor.codes">Vapor</a> and whether it is really a viable choice.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/jared-murray-974070-unsplash-e1552938209336-1024x512.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-551}</p><h2>A Plethora Of Choices</h2><p>Looking at the landscape of back end choices can be rather confusing. In the end, <strong>it really depends on team's skillset</strong>. For instance, if you're using JavaScript to build your web and mobile applications, Node.JS makes sense. On the other hand, if you are .Net developer team, Web API makes sense. Moreover, if you are particularly skilled with PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, etc..., you should stay within your comfort zone.</p><p>However for single developers and developer teams (such as me) which focus on Apple products, there isn't a dedicated framework for server-side applications. Therefore, the closest option is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/">CloudKit</a>, which is good for data storage but lacks options such as:</p><ul><li>No support outside of web and Apple devices</li><li>No support for complete backups</li><li>Locked into the CloudKit data model for relationships</li><li>No Cron Jobs</li></ul><p>However there are other options to remain developing in Swift on server.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/wordmark-horizontal-1024x271.png"/><p>{.wp-image-554}</p><h2>Vapor - Swift for the Server</h2><p>Since Swift was open sourced in late 2015, compatibility for other operating system has been added. One of the first teams to move Swift to the server was the Vapor team. Since the release of version 3.0 in May 2018, interest has grown.</p><p>In this article, I will review Vapor and cover:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="#getting-started">Ease of Installation and Deployment</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#developing">Developing For Vapor</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#database-support">Database Support</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#event-driven">Event-Driven Async API</a></strong></li></ul><p>Therefore, let's begin by talking about how easy it is to get started.</p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/getting-things-setup.jpg?fit=1024%2C512&ssl=1"/><p>{.wp-image-555}</p><h2>Getting Started with Vapor {#getting-started}</h2><p><a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/vapor-heroku-ubuntu-setup-deploy/?utm_medium=web&utm_source=learning-swift">In this article I recently published, I showed how to get started by installing Vapor on your Mac and Ubuntu as well as services like Heroku.</a> In short, <strong>I found the process to be pretty simple and effective</strong>. That is to say, it is no more complex then any other web framework.</p><p>For instance, on the Mac, developers can use <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, which is fairly common, to tap the Vapor repo and install. After you have access to the Vapor CLI tool which includes a subcommand for setting up your Heroku application with the Vapor buildpack.</p><p>Likewise on Ubuntu, you add the apt repo for Vapor and install via <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html.en">the</a> <em><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html.en">apt</a></em> <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/apt.html.en">command</a>. Having done that, you can easily use a combination of a process monitor and an http server to proxy the server.</p><p>If you are interested in more details on this process, <strong>check out <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/vapor-heroku-ubuntu-setup-deploy/?utm_medium=web&utm_source=learning-swift">this article which deep dives into Vapor and setting up for macOS, Heroku, and Ubuntu.</a></strong></p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/developer-tools-1024x512.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-558}</p><h2>Developing with Vapor {#developing}</h2><p>Having installed Vapor, the next part of the procedure is developing the app. As a result, the IDE is very important.</p><h3>Developer Tools with Vapor</h3><p>In spite of <a href="#Xcode-issues">its issues</a>, we can still develop in Swift with Xcode. However, since there are command line tools to build a Swift application and a developer could choose their own tool. At the present time, the real limitation is that Swift in general is only supported on macOS and Ubuntu. That is to say <strong>there is no support for other Linux or Unix operating systems as well as no support for Windows.</strong> However, the community is certainly moving forward with extending support in those areas. Similarly, the community has provided plenty of packages.</p><h3>Third Party Support for Vapor</h3><p>Node.js has npm, Ruby has gems, C# has Nuget, Python has pip and Swift has the <a href="https://swift.org/package-manager/">Swift Package Manager</a>. Generally speaking, the Swift Package Manager or SPM has been slowly adapted as the premier dependency manager. In the long run while Cocoapods and Carthage still reign in the area of iOS development, <strong>it is inevitable that SPM will dominate in the future</strong>. Having discussed outside support for Vapor, let's discuss what Vapor (and its package support currently).</p><h3>Database Support and Fluent ORM {#database-support}</h3><p>My experience working with various ORMs are varied. Being that I've worked with Entity Framework in C# and Sequelize for Node.Js, I have some experience. Having said that, <strong>what makes these work so well is the ability to use lambdas and implement many functional programming paradigms.</strong> As a result, since Swift has that ability, using the Fluent ORM is fairly easy to learn.</p><p>Equally important is its support of various database software. As of now, there is support for:</p><ul><li>MySQL</li><li>MariaDB</li><li>MongoDB</li><li>PostgreSQL</li><li>SQLite</li></ul><p>As can be seen, there is sufficient database support. Not to mention, but its support for those databases is fairly deep.</p><h4>Deep Database Support</h4><p>For instance, I ran into an issue where I was searching for objects by title - a fairly simple keyword search for a REST API list operation. However, what I didn't realize was that many titles have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic"><em>diacritcs</em></a>, specifically accents. In other words if a user searches for something with an <em>e</em> if a title has an <em>é</em>, that result won't show up. In spite of this, there is code in PostgreSQL to <em>unaccent</em> a string, such as there is a way to do lower or upper case transformation. Having adding the necessary functions, I am able to call the function with Fluent's API:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> columnId = <span class="type">PostgreSQLColumnIdentifier</span>.<span class="call">column</span>(<span class="string">"Game"</span>, <span class="string">"title"</span>)
<span class="keyword">let</span> column = <span class="type">PostgreSQLExpression</span>.<span class="call">column</span>(columnId)
<span class="keyword">let</span> arg = <span class="type">GenericSQLFunctionArgument</span>&lt;<span class="type">PostgreSQLExpression</span>&gt;.<span class="call">expression</span>(column)
<span class="keyword">let</span> args : [<span class="type">GenericSQLFunctionArgument</span>&lt;<span class="type">PostgreSQLExpression</span>&gt;] = [arg]

However what truly makes Fluent ORM so robust is the use of SwiftNIO async API.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/futures-and-promises-1024x512.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-559}</p><h3>The <em>Future</em> of Programming {#event-driven}</h3><p>In short, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-nio">SwiftNIO</a>, the event-driven network application framework started by Apple, provides a set of types for handling callback-based asynchronous APIs such as database queries.</p><p>[]{#Xcode-issues}</p><p>In addition, Vapor provides a set of functionality which make complex queries accessible in code. That is to say <strong>SwiftNIO and Vapor provides futures and promises as well as and API for dealing with multiple objects such as transformations</strong>. Despite this, <strong>the most significant friction I have found was the combination of Xcode and Swift compiler delivering misleading error message.</strong> At present, this is very common complaint with Swift and Xcode in general but it is certainly an issue worth mentioning. Likewise, I used the same async API when making various HTTP calls and found it very reliable.</p><h3>The REST of the API</h3><p>As opposed to URLRequest, <strong>the HTTP API is promise/future friendly</strong> which is nice improvement. However, any async call in Swift can easily be made friendly. In addition to the Fluent ORM, HTTP, and Async APIs, I did make use of the Auth, Crypto, and Routing APIs. In short, all worked flawlessly.</p><p>For instance, serialization from JSON or Multipart encoded data works without much needed implementation. That is to say, if you are implementing a type which correctly implements Codable then there should not be much extra effort in creating a robust REST API. However, if you do need to customize your type to use Codable, I highly recommend my post on improving how you decode JSON.</p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/03/swift-vapor-choice.jpg?fit=1024%2C512&ssl=1"/><p>{.wp-image-560}</p><h2>Vaporware or Swift-ly Switch?</h2><p>To sum up, <strong>Vapor is already a healthy framework to start any new server-side application</strong>. However, I would never recommend anyone rewrite their whole application in this.</p><p>Overall, <strong>if you are already Swift team and you are looking to move some if not all your code to a new framework, I'd highly recommend taking a look Vapor as your first choice.</strong> Not to mention, if you are using a web framework that is becoming a burden and <strong>enjoy the versatility of Swift, going with Vapor would be good fit</strong>. (Besides that, the only caveat I'd make is that if you are building for the enterprise I would look into <a href="https://www.kitura.io">Kitura</a>, the IBM team has plenty of experience in that space and <a href="https://www.kitura.io">Kitura</a> seems more focused in those regards.)</p><p>On the other hand, if you are using a web framework which has performed well for your team and most of your development is not in Swift, then switching to Vapor does not make sense. Lastly, I just wanted to point out, that Vapor works well outside of an Apple client application. For example, <strong><a href="https://redmushroom.club?utm_medium=web&utm_source=learning-swift">I successfully built a web application using VueJs and Axios</a> and had no difficulty when it came to server-client communication.</strong> If you are interested in getting started, <a href="http://eepurl.com/gk8mp5">subscribe to this newsletter</a>, to get started guide as well as updates on how to develop a robust application with Vapor.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/codable-4-ways-improve-decode-json</guid><title>codable-4-ways-improve-decode-json</title><description>Codable, introduced in Swift 4, provides a convenient and easy way to encode and decode JSON.

As an example, their JSON has a main tweet as well as <em>quoted tweets</em>. Therefore, one might be inclined to use the same structure for both. However, a better approach is two separate structures:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">public struct</span> Tweet : <span class="type">Codable</span> {
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> created_at : <span class="type">Date</span>

      <span class="keyword">public let</span> in_reply_to_screen_name : <span class="type">String</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> user : <span class="type">TweetUser</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> quoted_status : <span class="type">QuotedTweet</span>?
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> is_quote_status : <span class="type">Bool</span>

      <span class="keyword">public let</span> favorited : <span class="type">Bool</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> retweeted : <span class="type">Bool</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> possibly_sensitive : <span class="type">Bool</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> possibly_sensitive_appealable : <span class="type">Bool</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> lang : <span class="type">String</span>
      }

      <span class="keyword">public struct</span> QuotedTweet : <span class="type">Codable</span> {
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> created_at : <span class="type">Date</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> id : <span class="type">Int</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> full_text : <span class="type">String</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> display_text_range : [<span class="type">Int</span>]
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> entities : <span class="type">TweetEntities</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> user : <span class="type">TweetUser</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> source : <span class="type">String</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> extended_entities : <span class="type">TweetEntities</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> is_quote_status : <span class="type">Bool</span>
      <span class="keyword">public let</span> retweet_count : <span class="type">Int</span>

      <span class="keyword">public let</span> lang : <span class="type">String</span>
      }
</code></pre><p><strong>Therefore, this means duplicated fields. However, it also allows for better flexibility and easier JSON decoding</strong>. On the other hand, we can simplify these types when used as parameters in functions. For instance, let's say we need to print the tweet out:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> printTweet (<span class="keyword">_</span> tweet: <span class="type">Tweet</span>) {
      <span class="call">print</span>(tweet.<span class="property">full_text</span>)
      <span class="keyword">if let</span> quoted_status = tweet.<span class="property">quoted_status</span> {
      <span class="call">printTweet</span>(quoted_status)
      }
      }

      <span class="keyword">func</span> printTweet (<span class="keyword">_</span> tweet: <span class="type">QuotedTweet</span>) {
      <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"&gt;"</span>,tweet.<span class="property">full_text</span>)
      }
</code></pre><p>However, using some basic <em>Protocol-Oriented Programming</em>, we can in fact be optimize this. Firstly, we stub a function which prints out the tweet based on a protocol regardless of whether it is a <em>quoted tweet</em> or not.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> printTweet(<span class="keyword">_</span> tweet: <span class="type">TweetProtocol</span>, withQuoteLevel level: <span class="type">Int</span> = <span class="number">0</span>) {
      <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="type">String</span>(repeating: <span class="string">"&gt;"</span>, count: level),tweet.<span class="property">full_text</span>)
      <span class="keyword">if let</span> quotedTweet = tweet.<span class="property">quotedTweet</span> {
      <span class="call">printTweet</span>(quotedTweet, withQuoteLevel: level+<span class="number">1</span>)
      }
      }
</code></pre><p>Consequently, we create the protocol which has the properties we need for the function above.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">public protocol</span> TweetProtocol {
      <span class="keyword">var</span> full_text : <span class="type">String</span> { <span class="keyword">get</span> }
      <span class="keyword">var</span> quotedTweet : <span class="type">TweetProtocol</span>? { <span class="keyword">get</span> }
      }
</code></pre><p>Lastly, we implement the protocol for the two types we'll use it for -</p><p><code>Tweet</code> and <code>QuotedTweet</code>:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">extension</span> <span class="type">Tweet</span> : <span class="type">TweetProtocol</span> {
      <span class="keyword">public var</span> quotedTweet: <span class="type">TweetProtocol</span>? {
      <span class="keyword">return self</span>.<span class="property">quoted_status</span>
      }
      }

      <span class="keyword">extension</span> <span class="type">QuotedTweet</span> : <span class="type">TweetProtocol</span> {
      <span class="keyword">public var</span> quotedTweet: <span class="type">TweetProtocol</span>? {
      <span class="keyword">return nil</span>
      }
      }
</code></pre><p>Now <strong>we have better flexibility to work with Codable while at the same time adding similar functionality using <em>Protocols</em>.</strong> Next, let's cleanup the property names.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/hrtdxy5urbu.jpg"/>{width="400" height="267"} :::</p><h2>Custom Property Names</h2><p>One thing you notice about Twitter's JSON is that <strong>they use what's called</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case"><strong>snake-case</strong></a> <strong>for combining words in property names. As a result, underscores</strong> <code>_</code> <strong>are used for combining words in JSON keys.</strong> For instance, the property for the full text of a tweet is called <code>full_text</code>. However, <strong>the</strong> <a href="https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/#general-conventions"><strong>Swift API design guidelines</strong></a> <strong>recommend using</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case"><strong>camel case.</strong></a> <strong>Camel case capitalizes each new word.</strong> Consequently, our property name would be in this case would be <code>fullText</code>. Therefore, we have two ways of fixing this: <strong>custom CodingKeys or using a KeyEncodingStrategy.</strong></p><p>Custom CodingKeys allows us the most flexibility by allowing us to provide a map from JSON keys to property names. However, in this case <strong>there is a consistent strategy for mapping all keys to property names.</strong> Therefore, in this case, we'll use <code>KeyDecodingStrategy</code> specifically <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder/keydecodingstrategy/convertfromsnakecase"><code>KeyDecodingStrategy.convertFromSnakeCase</code></a>:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> decoder = <span class="type">JSONDecoder</span>()
      decoder.<span class="property">keyDecodingStrategy</span> = .<span class="dotAccess">convertFromSnakeCase</span>
</code></pre><p>In addition, if <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder/keydecodingstrategy/convertfromsnakecase"><code>KeyDecodingStrategy.convertFromSnakeCase</code></a> doesn't quite fit with your JSON keys, Swift does allow the use of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder/keydecodingstrategy/custom">custom strategies.</a> In other words, you can supply a closure for converting a CodingKey array to single CodingKey result.<br>Last but not least, if none of this strategies work for converting a key to a property name you can always supply a custom CodingKeys enumeration. <strong>In short, you want to use the simplest and most consistent strategy for mapping property names or JSON keys.</strong></p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/zmmxsrmsoi8.jpg"/>{width="400" height="281"} :::</p><h2>Custom Property Values</h2><p>Another quirk with Twitter's JSON data is how they format some of the property values. Let's take a look at the easiest to deal with which is dates.</p><h3>How to deal with Date</h3><p>By default, dates are serialized as a floating decimal specifically <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/timeinterval">TimeInterval</a> (number of seconds) since the <em>reference date</em> of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdate/1417376-timeintervalsincereferencedate">January 1st, 2001</a>. However, if the format from the JSON property value is different, you can use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder/datedecodingstrategy">one of the strategies available</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>iso8601</strong> - <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html">a standard format</a> used throughout the web</li><li><strong>secondsSince1970</strong> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">unix time</a> in seconds</li><li><strong>millisecondsSince1970</strong> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">unix time</a> in milliseconds</li></ul><p>Consequently, <strong>if the date format does not follow any of these you need to provide either a closure to convert it or a</strong> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter"><strong>DateFormatter</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The main way to specify the format in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter">DateFormatter</a> is with the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter/1413514-dateformat">dateFormat String property</a>. In other words, by using the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-31/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns">Unicode provided codes</a>, we can create a <em>dateFormat</em> string to represent the format of dates and times provided by Twitter. As a result, from the date</p><p><code>Mon Mar 28 14:39:13 +0000 2016</code> in our JSON, we can infer the format to be: <code>eee MMM dd HH:mm:ss ZZZZ yyyy</code>. Therefore, we can create a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter">DateFormatter</a> and set the strategy accordingly:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> dateFormat = <span class="string">"eee MMM dd HH:mm:ss ZZZZ yyyy"</span>

      <span class="keyword">let</span> dateFormatter = <span class="type">DateFormatter</span> ()
      dateFormatter.<span class="property">dateFormat</span> = dateFormat

      <span class="keyword">let</span> decoder = <span class="type">JSONDecoder</span>()
      decoder.<span class="property">dateDecodingStrategy</span> = .<span class="call">formatted</span>(dateFormatter)
      decoder.<span class="property">keyDecodingStrategy</span> = .<span class="dotAccess">convertFromSnakeCase</span>
      <span class="keyword">return</span> decoder
</code></pre><p>In conclusion, by customizing the DateFormatter, dates can be decoded as Date property values. However, colors will be slightly more challenging.</p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/02/f6xv0xs9jwg.jpg"/>{width="400" height="300"} :::</p><h3>Custom Decoding of Property Values {#custom-decoding}</h3><p>For colors such as the profile background color, we need to create a separate struct and implement the encoding and decoding ourselves to convert the hexidecimal string to a usable color structure:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">import</span> Foundation

      <span class="keyword">try</span> container.<span class="call">encode</span>(string)
      }
      }
</code></pre><p>In this case, we override the init method and grab the string from the</p><p><code>singleValueContainer</code>. After that, we use a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/scanner">Scanner</a> to convert the color hexcode into a hexidecimal number. Then use a combination of bitwise and logical operations to grab each component value in between 0 and 255. Lastly, we use decimal division to calculate the value in between 0 and 1. (I have also included the encode method for completion sake.) As a result, we can easily convert a hexcode String to a Color struct.</p><p>Since we can't use the existing system color types, here is the code to convert from our custom Color struct to whatever the system's default UI color type is:</p><pre><code><span class="preprocessing">#if os(iOS) || os(watchOS) || os(tvOS)</span>

Today, I'm going to talk about the challenges of using C++.</description><link>https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/integrating-c-plus-plus-swift</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2019 05:00:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the article <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/objective-c-and-swift-being-friendly/">Objective-C and Swift - Being Friendly</a>, I talked about how I used Objective-C to integrate C++ libraries with Swift in <a href="https://Speculid.com">Speculid</a>. Today, I'm going to talk about the challenges of using C++ Libraries in your XCode project.</p><p><a href="https://Speculid.com">Speculid is a completely open source application</a> built with the latest version of Xcode (10.1) primarily in Swift (I'll explain why primarily and not only). With Speculid, you <strong>can take a single graphic and build it into a complete App Icon or Image Set.</strong></p><p>Therefore, this meant packaging any required dependencies within the .App package. At first, I thought about including <em>Inkscape</em> and <em>ImageMagick</em> with the installation. However the fact that <em>Inkscape</em> has other dependencies such as <em>XQuartz</em> meant that would be too cumbersome. Therefore, Cairo and librsvg became the obvious choice.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/440px-Librsvg.svg_-e1541095349996.png"/><p>{.wp-image-201}<img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/11/500px-Cairo_banner_1.svg_-e1541095276942.png"/>{.wp-image-200}</p><h2>Integrating Cairo and librsvg with Swift</h2><p>The first version of Speculid required the installation of two software packages: <a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> and <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a>. Each application would be used in some combination to read, manipulate, and export SVG, PNG, JPEG, or PDF files. As a result, <strong>requiring these software packages made the user experience clumsy and difficult.</strong> However, since they are complete applications including both of these packages would be cumbersome as well. That's why I looked into integrating C++ libraries - specifically two of them: <a href="https://cairographics.org"><strong>Cairo</strong></a> <strong>and</strong> <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/rsvg/"><strong>libRSVG</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Used by several software packages, <strong>Cairo</strong> and <strong>librsvg</strong> are the leading libraries for the development of graphics and SVG manipulation software especially in the open source and Linux communities. <strong>So with Speculid v2.0, I integrated and packaged these libraries as the primary means of reading PNG and SVG and exporting PDF and PNG files</strong>. Above all, both of these libraries can be installed on your Mac through <a href="http://brew.sh"><strong>HomeBrew</strong></a>, using the command:</p><p><code>brew install cairo librsvg</code></p><p>Now we'll need to make sure to copy and link the files.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/xe7za0jttem-e1547589614468-1024x513.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-350}</p><h2>Properly Linking and Copying C++ Libraries</h2><p>[[I]{style="caret-color: #191e23; background-color: #ffffff;"}]{style="color: #191e23;"}n order to use C++ libraries, <strong>we can either compile every piece of C++ code as their individual libraries within Speculid or integrate the already compiled libraries.</strong> At first it seemed compiling the code would be the most clean and efficient way, except for the fact that each library had many requirements as well as special flags for compiling each library. Therefore I decided to take a different route and use the compiled libraries themselves.</p><p>After installing the libraries using HomeBrew, copy the directories for Cairo and librsvg to your project folder. <strong>HomeBrew stores its applications and libraries at:</strong></p><pre><code>/usr/local/<span class="type">Cellar</span>
</code></pre><p>Therefore, <strong>Cairo</strong>, for instance, would be located at:</p><pre><code>/usr/local/<span class="type">Cellar</span>/cairo
</code></pre><p>Once it's copied to your project, there are three spots the files need to be under <strong>build phases:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Link With Libraries - </strong>all <strong>.dylib</strong> files need to be listed</li><li><strong>Copy Files -</strong> all <strong>.dylib</strong> files need to be copied to the <strong>Frameworks</strong> folder</li><li><strong>Headers -</strong> all <strong>.h</strong> files need to be listed under <strong>Project</strong></li></ul><p><strong>After that, you should be good to go.</strong> If you have any issues with building the application, <strong>double check all the proper files are listed under build phases in your Xcode projec</strong>t.</p><img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/eiwvoa9zb10-e1547589663680-1024x512.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-351}</p><h3>Staying Organized in Dependency Hell</h3><p>With your C++ libraries linked and embedded, you run the app and it works without a hitch. So then you archive and package your product and send it off for someone to run and they get something like this:</p><pre><code>dyld: <span class="type">Library</span> not loaded: <span class="keyword">@loader</span> _path/../lib/libintl.<span class="number">8</span>.<span class="property">dylib</span>
</code></pre><p><strong>Unfortunatley libraries like Cairo and librsvg, often have dependencies of their own which are required.</strong> However there are a few commands to help with this:</p><ul><li><code>otool -L</code><br> If we want to find out actual dependencies, this command displays names and version numbers of libraries which are required and used by a particular library.</li><li><code>brew deps —tree</code><br> In order to make sure we have all the dependencies installed on the developer machine, we can use HomeBrew to find their dependencies installed along with the package. Once they are installed we can add them to our project and include them in the App package</li><li><code>install_name_tool</code><br> Once the dependencies are copied and included with our App, we need to update the paths used to look for our dependencies.</li></ul><h4>Gathering Dependencies</h4><p>Firstly we need to make sure we've included all the dependencies in your App by adding the dynamic libraries described by <code>otool -L</code>. For instance if we ran <code>otool -L</code> on the Cairo library we get this:</p><pre><code>$ otool -<span class="type">L</span> libcairo.<span class="number">2</span>.<span class="property">dylib</span>

With the introduction of C++ libraries in version 2.0 of Speculid, Objective-C became necessary.</description><link>https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/objective-c-and-swift-being-friendly</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2018 05:23:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are times where Objective-C is still necessary for Swift development. For instance, with one such app I've built in Swift, <a href="https://speculid.com/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=blog-post&utm_campaign=building-speculid">Speculid</a>, I needed to bring Objective-C code in. With the introduction of C++ libraries in version 2.0, Objective-C became necessary. Luckily there are ways to make both Objective-C and Swift work together in a friendly fashion.</p><h2>Simplifying Installation with C++ Libraries</h2><p>Speculid is a completely open source application built with the latest version of Xcode. It <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/app-icon-templates-graphics-xcode/">automates the process of converting PNG and SVG files into complete Image Sets and App Icons.</a> In the first version, it required the installation of Inkscape and ImageMagick to facilitate the conversion of images from SVG or PNG to PDF or PNG. This became cumbersome both in the installation and usage. With version 2.0, I wanted to make the process of installation and integration as easy as possible by removing any prerequisites steps and pre-existing dependencies. This meant packaging any required dependencies within the application package. In this case, we are using two C++ libraries, <a href="https://cairographics.org"><em>Cairo</em></a> and <em><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/LibRsvg">libRSVG</a></em>. <em>Cairo</em> is the leading 2D library used throughout the open source community and <em>libRSVG</em> is used for reading SVG content. With these two libraries available, the challenge then became integrating them into the Swift code. As of now, Swift has no way to directly interface with C++. Therefore, we need an intermediary and those intermediaries can either be code in C or Objective-C. While C has some simplicity to it, in this case, I went with Objective-C.</p><h2>Bridging the Gap with Objective-C</h2><p>Not only do I have experience with Objective-C, but Objective-C has a strong integration with the Apple ecosystem; despite the simplicity of C. While I am using Objective-C, I want to keep the bulk of the code in Swift. Objective-C will only serve to interface with the C++ libraries as needed. Swift will interact with the user, manage jobs, etc... Objective-C will call the C++ libraries to build the actual graphics. The Swift code will be completely unaware of the code actually used to read, manipulate, and write the resulting files. Here is a brief rundown of the process:</p><ul><li><strong>Main</strong> - instantiate and run NSApplication</li><li><strong>SpeculidApplication</strong> - looks for the <em>speculid</em> file and parses the file using <em>Codable</em><ul><li>Finds the source graphic file (PNG or SVG)</li><li>Parses the <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/asset-catalogs-image-sets-app-icons/">Asset Catalog</a> file</li><li>Parses the specifications in the <em>speculid</em> file</li><li>Creates the specifications to be passed to the Objective-C code</li><li><strong>In Objective-C</strong>, use the specifications passed to call the C++ functions to write out the target graphic files (PNG or PDF)</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Writing Swift-Friendly Code in Objective-C</h2><p>There are a couple of ways to make our Objective-C and Swift code work well together. One is making sure the API uses compatible types.</p><h3>Using Protocols to Facilitate Communication</h3><p>Objective-C does not use Swift Structs. This leaves Classes as the only way to pass complex data between the Swift and the Objective-C framework. However, in order to keep the interfaces agnostic of each other, we can create Protocols in the Objective-C API which can signify to Swift what is required. In our Objective-C framework, there are two methods available to Swift. The main method which calls the <em>Cairo</em> library and takes an <em>ImageSpecificationProtocol</em> and an <em>ImageHandle</em> object:</p><p>@interface CairoInterface : NSObject + (BOOL)exportImage:(id<ImageHandle>) sourceHandle withSpecification: (id<ImageSpecificationProtocol>) specification error: (NSError **) error;
    @end

#### Abstracting with Protocols

*ImageHandle* is another Protocol which the Objective-C framework will
use containing the painting surface needed by Cairo. However, the Swift
framework doesn't need to know anything about Cairo. So how does Swift
create an *ImageHandle* without having access to the Cairo surface
reference? That\'s where the other method comes in. We provide a
builder/factory class in the Objective-C class which takes parameters
available in Swift:

    @interface ImageHandleBuilder : NSObject
    @property (class, nonatomic, assign, readonly) ImageHandleBuilder*  shared;
    - (id<ImageHandle>) imageHandleFromFile: (id<ImageFileProtocol>) file error:(NSError**) error;
    @end

The *ImageFileProtocol* protocol looks this:

    @protocol ImageFileProtocol <NSObject>
    @property (readonly) NSURL * _Nonnull url;
    @property (readonly) ImageFileFormat format;
    @end

#### Protocols as Guidance

*ImageFileFormat* is an enum which is available in Swift and denotes a
file type (PNG, PDF, or SVG). *NSURL* is automatically taken care of and
will be a *URL* in Swift. As long as we implement *ImageFileProtocol *in
Swift with these properties and it subclasses *NSObject*, we can easily
pass that object to *ImageHandleBuilder*, we should be able to call the
ImageHandleBuilder easily. This goes the same
for *ImageSpecificationProtocol*
in`CairoInterace.exportImage:withSpecification:error:`.
ImageSpecificationProtocol contains the information needed to know what
and how the information is painted:

    @protocol ImageSpecificationProtocol <NSObject>
    @property (readonly) id<ImageFileProtocol> file;
    @property (readonly) GeometryDimension geometry;
    @property (readonly) BOOL removeAlphaChannel;
    @property (readonly) id<CairoColorProtocol> backgroundColor;
    @end

Let's look at each of these properties excluding ImageFileProtocol which
we already talked about\...

-   *removeAlphaChannel* which is a boolean value and that's transferred
    between languages easily.
-   *geometry is* *GeometryDimension,* a C struct which contains
    information about which dimension to scale based on (width, height
    or scale) and the size. ``
-   *backgroundColor is* *CairoColorProtocol* which contains information
    about the background color in case you need an image without a
    transparency and your source image has a transparency (i.e. App
    Icons).

With the *CairoColorProtocol,* we could simply create a new class
that contains the info that is needed. However, in Swift, we could
minimize new code by simply using an Extension on an existing class.

### Using Extensions to Add Functionality to Existing Classes

Here is how the protocol for *CairoColorProtocol* looks in Objective-C:

    @protocol CairoColorProtocol <NSObject>
    @property (readonly) double red;
    @property (readonly) double green;
    @property (readonly) double blue;
    @end

In this case rather [then]{.ul} creating a new class to implement this
in Swift we can extend existing class: NSColor. Here the [simple]{.ul}
implementation [as a Swift extension]{.ul}:

    extension NSColor: CairoColorProtocol {
      public var red: Double {
        return Double(redComponent)
      }

      public var green: Double {
        return Double(greenComponent)
      }

      public var blue: Double {
        return Double(blueComponent)
      }
    }

Now we can easily communicate between Swift and Objective-C. However,
there are a couple of improvements we could make to our Objective-C code
to make it even better for Swift.

## Writing Swift friendly code in Objective-C

Since day one of Swift, working with Objective-C has been a requirement
in some way. As the years have passed, Objective-C has added attributes
to make it friendly to paradigms in Swift. There are two main ways we'll
look at: **error handling** and **optionals**.

### Error Handling

Since the inclusion of try statements in Swift 2.0, we've replaced the
need for NSError pointers as parameters in Swift. However, if you follow
the standard NSError paradigms in Objective-C, Swift will see that
method as though it could throw an Error. Here's an example from the
CairoInterface class:

    @interface CairoInterface : NSObject
    +  (BOOL)exportImage:(id<ImageHandle>) sourceHandle withSpecification: (id<ImageSpecificationProtocol>) specification error: (NSError **) error;
    @end

Swift will see this as:

    class CairoInterface : NSObject {
        static func exportImage(_ sourceHandle: ImageHandle!, withSpecification specification: ImageSpecificationProtocol!) throws
    }

Two things are required for the translation to an error throwing
function:

-   the return is a boolean which indicates true for success, false for
    failure
-   an NSError pointer parameter specifically named error

Let's take a look again at the ImageHandleBuilder method:

    @interface ImageHandleBuilder : NSObject
    @property (class, nonatomic, assign, readonly) ImageHandleBuilder*  shared;
    - (id<ImageHandle>) imageHandleFromFile: (id<ImageFileProtocol>) file error:(NSError**) error;
    @end

The difference is that it returns an actual value possibly. Otherwise,
we still have an NSError pointer parameter named error.

    class ImageHandleBuilder : NSObject {
        func imageHandleFromFile(_ file: ImageFileProtocol!) throws -> ImageHandle!
    }

By following this standard, we've made error handling much cleaner and
easier between languages. However, we still have annoying implicit
optionals. Luckily there's a way to fix that as well.

### Optionals and Objective-C

One of the first features of Swift was the idea of Optionals. Optionals
remove the ambiguity of pointers used by Objective-C. Unfortunately, for
each of these pointers in Objective-C, Swift sees an implicitly
unwrapped optional. You can read more about [optionals and implicitly
unwrapped optionals
here.](https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/understanding-optionals-in-swift/)
Luckily, there are Objective-C attributes which can help clarify
optionals better. Objective-C has two attributes to signify to Swift
whether a parameter, property, or return value is optional or not:
`_Nonnull` and `_Nullable`. Let's look again at *ImageHandleBuilder*:

    @interface ImageHandleBuilder : NSObject
    @property (class, nonatomic, assign, readonly) ImageHandleBuilder*  shared;
    - (id<ImageHandle>) imageHandleFromFile: (id<ImageFileProtocol>) file error:(NSError**) error;
    @end

We have a singleton, `shared` which must exist and we have a function
`imageHandleFromFile:error:` which needs an ImageFileProtocol and may
return an ImageHandle. There, the property `shared `needs to
be  `_Nonnull``` and the `file` parameter in
`imageHandleFromFile:error:` needs to be `_Nonnull`. Since
`imageHandleFromFile:error:` can fail and throw an error, the return
type must be optional so we mark that we the `_Nullable` attribute. Here
is the result:

    @interface ImageHandleBuilder : NSObject
    @property (class, nonatomic, assign, readonly) ImageHandleBuilder* _Nonnull shared;
    - (id<ImageHandle> _Nullable) imageHandleFromFile: (id<ImageFileProtocol> _Nonnull) file error:(NSError**) error;
    @end

So now rather than Swift seeing:

    class ImageHandleBuilder : NSObject {
        class var shared : ImageHandleBuilder! { get }
        func imageHandleFromFile(_ file: ImageFileProtocol!) throws -> ImageHandle!
    }

We'll see:

    class ImageHandleBuilder : NSObject {
        class var shared : ImageHandleBuilder { get }
        func imageHandleFromFile(_ file: ImageFileProtocol) throws -> ImageHandle?
    }

This makes the API much more understandable in Swift and easier to
interface with.

## Making Code Friendly

When you need to write Objective-C code or perhaps you are in the
process of migrating Objective-C code over to Swift. There are a few
things you can do:

-   If you can to keep as much as code in Swift as possible, **write
    Protocols in Objective-C and implementation (i.e. Classes) in
    Swift**
-   **Use Protocol to guide the API for other frameworks and libraries**
-   **Use Extensions to avoid duplicating types** and reuse existing
    types.
-   In Objective-C, if your function can throw an Error, **use the
    standard paradigm in so Swift interprets your code correctly**
-   **Mark your Objective-C generously** with attributes to note whether
    a parameter, return type, etc\... is nullable or not.

Next, we\'ll be talking about using those C++ libraries in a framework.

Today we are going to talk about using app icon templates in Sketch and Photoshop.</p><h2>Using App Icon Templates</h2><p>App Icon templates offer a simple and predictable way to create your assets while using graphics applications designers are familiar with. We are going to look at the top two graphic editors: <strong>Sketch</strong> and <strong>Photoshop</strong>.</p><h3>Sketch</h3><p>::: {.wp-block-embed_<em>wrapper} https://youtu.be/4Um</em>zRh4ENY :::</p><p>In the last few years, Sketch has grown to be one of the leading applications used by graphic designers especially in the area of mobile application development. Luckily they already supply an app icon template to use.</p><ol><li>Run your Sketch Application and the launching dialog should appear showing various templates built into Sketch.</li><li>Select the <strong>iOS App Icon</strong> template. Now, you should see the template with various sizes of the app icon.</li><li>Go ahead and edit the largest icon. As you edit the large icon, you changes should be reflected in your other app icon sizes.</li><li>When completed, go to the top menu and select <strong>Export</strong>. In the Export dialog, select all the sizes you wish to export and then choose the folder you wish to export to.</li></ol><p>If you go to that folder, you should see all your icon sizes. From there you can drag the files into your Asset catalog App Icon slots.</p><p>Sketch offers a very simple way to export the set of graphics. Obviously, each time an edit needs to be made, Sketch will need to be accessed and the multiple files will need to be updated in the repo.</p><h3>Photoshop</h3><p>::: {.wp-block-embed__wrapper} https://youtu.be/yr6KsuP5j5A :::</p><p>Photoshop has been a well established graphics editor for over two decades. However it isn't quite as targeted toward application development as Sketch so it isn't geared as much towards that purpose.</p><p>Kindly enough Apple offers us UI templates and widget for Photoshop (as well as constantly updated for Sketch) through their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/">Apple Design Resources page</a>.</p><ol><li>Go to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/">Apple Design Resources page</a> and download the template for the OS you will be building for. In this case we will be using the iOS 12 version. **Please note - these downloads are quite large so make sure to do this ahead of time.**</li><li>Unzip the template collection, go to the <em>Production Templates</em> folder. We'll be using the standard <em>Template-AppIcons-iOS.psd</em> file. Open that psd file, opening Photoshop.</li><li>Make sure we are generating image assets on save. Go to File...Generate...Image Assets and make sure it is checked.</li><li>Go to your layers window and double click the layer named icon. This is the layer you will be editing directly and will be carried through to the other app icon sizes.</li><li>Go to the folder containing the psd file you have opened. You should see a folder with the same name but including the suffix <em>-assets</em>. In there you should see all the icon sizes exported from the template.</li></ol><p>Photoshop is the more established application but also less focused on UI and App Icon development. The templates can be quite large and even more cumbersome to open each time and edit can be made.</p><p>Ideally, we'd like to simply edit one file which can be included in our repo and automatically generated on the build. That's where building a bash script to run on the build would be helpful.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/new-apple-watch-4</guid><title>new-apple-watch-4</title><description>The new Apple Watch 4 brings new health functionality and updated hardware.

With a truckload of new health functionality and bigger screens, is now the time to bring a watch app to market?</p><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/44627298022_6298cab03c_k.jpg" alt="A new Apple Watch 4 is ready to take an electrocardiogram."/><p>{.wp-image-1465}</p><h2>Health Features</h2><p>While the new Apple watch announcement touted all sorts of functionality, health features took a starring role.</p><h3>Basic Electrocardiogram</h3><p>First, this watch can now <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-watch-series-4/">take a basic electrocardiogram (ECG)</a>. While this in no way replaces a full ECG workup in a hospital or doctor's office, it should be a useful indicator that something could be up with your heart and worth discussing with your doctor.</p><p>Apple immediately tempered any skepticism of the watch's ability to perform a medical function by announcing...</p><h3>FDA and AHA Support</h3><p>Both the Food and Drug Administration and the American Heart Association gave the new watch a qualified endorsement. While it could take 5-10 years for a watch to be officially considered a medical device, both organizations consider the health features that Apple is putting into the watch a good thing.</p><h3>Siri! I've Fallen!</h3><p>The new Apple watch added another health feature that alerts both wearer and potentially emergency services when the wearer falls. If the accelerometer in the watch registers a fall, it notifies the wearer. If the wearer does not respond to the notification, Siri will call out to emergency services.</p><p>It is not yet clear how the watch handles edge cases. For example, if someone gets drunk and passes out, will Siri phone 911? Still, this technology could increase the independence of seniors and other users with mobility issues.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d0/Apple_Watch_Series_4_40mm_space_gray_Aluminum.jpg/533px-Apple_Watch_Series_4_40mm_space_gray_Aluminum.jpg" alt="The new apple watch 4."/><p><br></p><h3>Hardware Changes</h3><p>While health functionality headlined the show, the Apple watch 4's new hardware was nothing to sneeze at. An upgraded processor makes the watch twice as fast as its predecessors (in terms of processing speed). Even more striking is the increased screen size on the watch face.</p><p>Thankfully the new screen sizes will work with the previous generation of watch bands. For example, the new 40mm screen will work with the older 38mm watch bands. But with the increased screen size and reduced bezel, that same new 40mm screen will have more usable screen space than the old 42mm screen did.</p><h2>When Should I Make A Watch App?</h2><p>With the renewed emphasis on health apps and the increased screen space, does it make sense for your business to make a watch app?</p><p>First, anyone in health or fitness should consider adding a watch app to their offering. Apple has both grown the market for smartwatches and demonstrated that users are interested in health and fitness tracking. <br> Second, the new Apple watch is still a fantastic platform for any feature that tracks time or time-based activities.</p><p>Third, though the iPhone isn't going anywhere, as a platform it's stabilized. The Apple watch still has plenty of room for growth, and that means more business opportunities.</p><p>Fourth, if you have already an iPhone app, it likely makes sense to add watch notifications if you haven't already. The watch is not a device that you can purchase and run solo; it needs an iPhone to unlock its full capabilities.</p><h2>Where Can I Hear More About the New Apple Watch?</h2><p>For a wide-ranging discussion, check out the <a href="https://www.empowerapps.show/5">Empower Apps podcast episode on the Apple Watch Series 4.</a></p><p>If you need help bringing a watch app to market, <a href="https://brightdigit.com/contact/">get in touch with BrightDigit</a>.

They all accurately recognize it as the next major sea change, and recognize that investment in AI technology will result in better products in both enterprise and consumer software.<br> Apple has been baking machine learning capable tools into XCode and Swift for years now. CoreML and create-ml are two examples of this.<br> Google has probably the most recognizable efforts in AI today. You can see AI at work in Gmail's auto suggestions; in Google Photos' assistant, automatically suggesting styling options and tagging; in Google Translate; and in Google Home, answering your queries.<br></p><h2>What specific area do you think is the most exciting?</h2><p>I'm most excited about transfer learning and one shot encoding. Both techniques allow regular folks to get great results without access to powerful hardware or large data sets.<br> Technology-wise, I'm most excited about the idea of GANs. GAN stands for Generative Adversarial Network, and the idea is to take two neural networks and pit them against each other. For instance, one application has a neural network attempting to generate realistic celebrity faces, while another attempts to pinpoint the fakes. The final result is indistinguishable from real photos. These kinds of tools will enable great new bounds in human creativity and innovation.</p><h2>What is the best way someone can get started in learning more about bots and machine learning?</h2><p><strong>Fast.ai and Andrew Ng's Coursera course are probably the most popular beginner intros to deep learning.</strong> They're both wonderful introductions to the field.<br> From there, it's largely up to your specific interests. Images and vision, natural text, reinforcement learning, and others are all differing specialties that require their own sets of skills. Kaggle is a great data science website that posts challenges you can compete in as well.<br> <strong>My recommendation would be to figure out what excites you about the field and focus on a single area.</strong> I'm particularly interested in applied machine learning, and so my focus has been on inference in the browser, leveraging transfer learning.<br></p><h2>How can the average businessperson leverage the power of machine learning?</h2><p>If you're sitting on a large amount of data there are likely opportunities for machine learning. <strong>A good rule of thumb is to look for things having to do with prediction. Anywhere there's patterns, it's likely that a machine learning model could generate predictions automatically.</strong></p><hr><p>If you are interested in learning more about Machine Learning, I highly recommend subscribing to <a href="https://thekevinscott.com/">Kevin's blog</a> to learn more.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/new-macbook-air-new-mac-mini</guid><title>new-macbook-air-new-mac-mini</title><description></description><link>https://brightdigit.com/articles/new-macbook-air-new-mac-mini</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Sep 2018 16:02:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2018/09/04/empowerapps-show-september-12th-apple-event/">the Apple event on September 12</a>, Apple unveiled new iPhones and the latest Apple Watch. But many people are still hoping for a new Mac Book Air and new Mac Mini. As a result, Apple watchers expect more revelations in October.</p><h2><strong>What is the Mac</strong> Mini?</h2><p>This small desktop computer first came out in 2005, and has not had an update since 2014. It has many great uses, but since it hasn't been updated in four years it is very slow compared to newer machines. It's a small, solid budget system because it doesn't come with peripherals. But now it's ancient and overpriced.</p><h2>Current vs. New Mac Mini</h2><p>Many people use the Mini as part of a home theater system and as a server. Apple TV is good, but it doesn't have as much storage as a Mini, and it's not as flexible. It's common for people to use an app such as Plex to store movies along with the Mini.</p><p>There is also a gap in the market for a Mac server. A Mac Mini would be a reasonable choice as a build server or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/xcode_guide-continuous_integration/">continuous integration server</a> for apps intended for proprietary Apple hardware. A continuous integration server would merge all code changes and verify all tests pass in the background on as many environments needed.</p><p>While there's plenty folks can do on a Linux server, there's still a desire for an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macmini/comments/613r2p/mac_mini_as_a_headless_server/">Apple <em>headless server</em></a>. In other words a machine running in the background with no need for a monitor, and running proprietary Apple processes like AirPrint, AirDrop, and Xcode Server.</p><h2>The State of the MacBook Air</h2><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/goran-ivos-771531-unsplash.jpg" alt="The MacBook Air<br>"/>{.wp-image-1437} :::</p><p>The MacBook Air is in a similar situation as the Mini. It has been around for ages but hasn't been updated. Regardless, it's been particularly popular in enterprise and education markets. We speculate that Apple will either upgrade it or come out with a new, less expensive model.</p><p>In 2015, Apple did come out with the MacBook, which perhaps was Apple's first attempt at replacing the Air. Unfortunately the base price for the cheapest MacBook model is still $1300 - well above the $1000 Air. As a result many customers still buy the MacBook Air. A $1000 MacBook looks like a real market opportunity for both Apple and its customers.</p><p>Despite this opportunity, Apple has some real incentives to hold off on releasing a new Mac Mini or a new Air. Growing the iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch has been a larger priority and taken the lion's share of Apple's development capacity. The Air continues to sell well. And since the parts for it keep getting cheaper, the product's profit margins improve just by changing nothing.</p><h2>Interested in Air or Mini?</h2><p>If you want to purchase an Air or a Mini, we recommending waiting to see what happens in October. If Apple releases new devices, the landscape will change.

I have been to many developer conferences over the years but lately I have been attending mostly business and startup conferences (i.e. <a href="https://www.microconf.com">MicroConf</a> and <a href="https://releasenotes.tv">Release Notes</a>).</p><p>Additionally, this is the first Apple developer conference I have ever attended as opposed to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-CocoaHeads/">hosting</a>, attending, and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/A2-CocoaHeads/events/246212307/">speaking</a> at a Cocoaheads groups. This was a new environment.</p><p>I wanted to get a feel of where the winds are blowing in Swift and there were some interesting trends to the topics presented:</p><h2>ARKit and CoreML</h2><p>Big surprise right! 🙃</p><p>Apple has been showcasing and backing these technologies for a while. Except for my occasional attempts at creating models, I haven't been doing enough in this area and these talks reinforce my need to do so. <a href="https://twitter.com/tryswiftnyc">Aileen Nielsen</a> really broke down how Machine Learning works. <a href="https://twitter.com/bertadevant">Berta Devant</a> explained how ARKit does face tracking and can be used. <a href="https://twitter.com/mataharimau">Audrey Tam</a> explained how to build your own model using Apple's new tools. <a href="https://twitter.com/kenmaz">Kentaro Matsumae</a> showed a great application using his <em>Super Resolution</em> technique. Overall the need to invest time in Machine Learning technology will continue to grow.</p><h2>Swift on the Server</h2><p>Swift on the server is real and there is real corporate backing to it. I happen to attend the workshop by IBM on <a href="https://www.kitura.io">Kitura</a> and got a glimpse of how to develop and deploy with Docker and Kubernetes. <a href="https://twitter.com/gopalkri">Gopal Sharma</a> spoke about the challenges he's faced with Swift on the server. <a href="https://twitter.com/johannesweiss">Johannes Weiss</a> spoke about <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-nio">SwiftNIO</a> which is the future of client and server side communication. <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris__Bailey">Chris Bailey</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/alfa">Ian Partridge</a> went into detail of Kitura's deployment process and its future and <a href="https://twitter.com/logmaestro">Logan Wright</a> spoke about <a href="https://vapor.codes">Vapor</a>.</p><p>If companies continue to adopt Vapor and Kitura, we'll continue to see growth in that space. It's something Swift developers should seriously spend some time understanding.</p><h2>Podcasting</h2><p>Podcasts continue to be a growing area. I am the host of two podcasts: <a href="https://okproductive.com">OkProductive</a> and <a href="https://www.empowerapps.show">EmpowerApps.Show</a>. I have followed podcast networks like <a href="https://www.relay.fm">Relay Fm</a> and <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com">Gimlet</a>, as well as software creators like <a href="https://transistor.fm">Marco Arment</a> and <a href="https://transistor.fm">Justin Jackson</a>. So it was really interesting to see <a href="https://twitter.com/leahculver">Leah Culver</a> from Breaker talk about their story and what she's learned about growing a software company. It'll be interesting to see what other startups flourish in this new industry.</p><h2>Other Topics...</h2><p>Other Swift topics which were of interest to me included:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/ChristinaMltn">Christina Moulton</a> talking about <strong>Siri Shortcuts</strong></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/atomicbird">Tom Harrington</a> on <a href="https://halide.cam">Core Data in Swift</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/KrauseFx">Felix Krause</a> from <a href="https://fastlane.tools">Fastlane</a> on trusting 3rd-party SDKs</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/steipete">Peter Steinberger</a> on hacking Marzipan (i.e. using UIKit to build Mac Apps)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/kthomas901">Kaya Thomas</a> on building advanced notifications</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/sdw">Sebastiaan de With</a> on building delightful user interfaces at Apple and now with <a href="https://halide.cam">Halide</a></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>try!Swift was a great conference and a great opportunity to meet a lot of great people in the Swift space. If you are in the Swift space, especially a beginner, I would definitely recommend checking it out.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/apple-september-event-2018</guid><title>apple-september-event-2018</title><description>What new goodies await us at the 2018 Apple September Event? Dig in to the rumored iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and laptop releases with Bright Digit.</description><link>https://brightdigit.com/articles/apple-september-event-2018</link><pubDate>Thu, 6 Sep 2018 08:00:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, developers and consumers alike eagerly await the <strong>Apple September event.</strong> Why are they feeling so much anticipation for <strong>September 12th</strong>?</p><p>At <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2018/">this event</a>, Apple typically announces and unveils the latest iPhone and other devices. And beforehand, everyone loves to guess what will happen. <strong>What are the best guesses and leaks?</strong></p><p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/0a6ef07b-2d53-4092-b582-b7a535fb78e6.png" alt="Size and Feature Comparison of the 2018 Apple September Event iPhones"/>{.wp-image-1414} :::</p><p>Everyone is convinced that we will see three new iPhones: <strong>an improved X, a plus-sized X, and a "budget" version of the X</strong>. We also hear rumors of a <strong>new Apple Watch</strong>.</p><h2>6.1 inch iPhone 9</h2><p>Rumor has it Apple <strong>will be releasing a new 6.1 inch iPhone with an LCD display and only one camera lens.</strong> The LCD display and one camera lens will likely reduce the cost of this phone and make it more competitive with other smart phones in the market. The rumored price on the device for the Apple September event is around $600 - $700 USD.</p><h2>iPhone Xs Plus</h2><p>The iPhone Xs plus will have the usual number of camera lenses, as well as the OLED screen. The dual lens camera offers greater zoom levels and a portrait mode. While the OLED screen reduces battery usage while giving a more natural blacks on the screen.</p><p>However, <strong>the biggest difference will be the size: 6.5 inches.</strong> This means it will be nearly the same size as previous plus sized phones but with a large screen. The iPhone Xs Plus will have the same top notch and all screen front display. There will be updates to the processor, likely from the A11 Bionic, and there may be updates to the material and color options.</p><p>This will probably be the release cycle in which no new iPhones have a Home button. Meanwhile, the Face ID technology could be improved on the new model this year. Plus-sized iPhones are not the only ones getting an update at the Apple September event as far as more screen and less bezel but the Apple Watch as well.</p><h2>Apple Watch Series 4</h2><p>The new Series 4 Apple watch is rumored to have the most striking changes. <strong>The bezel size will also be dramatically reduced, making the display larger by going edge-to-edge.</strong> Having a larger display should allow the user to see <strong>more information and widgets at all time</strong>s.</p><p>In a welcome move for consumers, <strong>the bands from the previous version will still fit this latest model</strong>, and the Apple Watch will remain waterproof.</p><p>The Apple Watch has seen steady improvements in processor, battery, and communication. This new model will the larger display is certainly the biggest improvement yet.<br></p><h2>A New iPad?</h2><p>Also rumored: <strong>a new iPad Pro that will continue the trend of less bezel and a larger display</strong>. This could also mean that <strong>Face ID will be moving to the iPad as well.</strong> If this happens, this should greatly improve the login user experience. On the iPad, especially, it can be extremely cumbersome to put your thumb on the device if it is at a distance. And instead of using the home button, the user will use gestures (swiping) to navigate the device.</p><h2>New Laptops Too?</h2><p>There are also rumors of a new "budget" MacBook (i.e. MacBook Air) and a new Mac mini. We'll have to wait and see just how the upgrades stack up.</p><h2>Want to find out more about the upcoming Apple September event?</h2><p><strong>Be sure to check out the latest <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2018/09/04/empowerapps-show-september-12th-apple-event/">episode of the EmpowerApps.Show podcast</a></strong> where Leo and Theresa dig deeper into the upcoming Apple releases.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/tim-haines-marketing-hackers</guid><title>tim-haines-marketing-hackers</title><description>Tim Haines of Symposia Labs in Holland is presenting for our Lansing Marketing Hackers October 10th event at WLNS on Facebook and Instagram Advertising.</description><link>https://brightdigit.com/articles/tim-haines-marketing-hackers</link><pubDate>Tue, 4 Sep 2018 05:25:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>::: {.wp-block-image} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DSC_0579.jpg" alt="Tim Haines of Symposia Labs"/>{.wp-image-1339} :::</p><p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-Marketing-Hackers/">Lansing Marketing Hackers</a> was a great success last year, both in attendance and speakers.

He also host <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/drinksanddigital/">Drinks and Digital</a></strong> in Lansing, Holland, Grand Rapids, Grand Haven, and Chicago.</p><p>We got a chance to ask Tim a few questions on how he got started and what he thinks are important for people to understand about online marketing and advertising.</p><h2>How did you get involved in marketing and advertising?</h2><p>I fell in love with digital marketing both slowly and all at once with lots of stops and starts. I did event marketing for three years with a free-tax filing program sponsored by the United Way. After that, <strong>I went into marketing and started freelancing and found West Michigan to be a place that encouraged a startup mindset.</strong> One by one, I found others to join my team and that's how Symposia was born.</p><h2>What have you seen change over your time in the marketing space?</h2><p>Almost everything. <strong>Social media advertising has become a key part of most digital strategies. That's why advertisers continue to offer new and innovated products that allow for more precise targeting than ever before.</strong> New channels (such as Snapchat) have entered the landscape. Old platforms (remember MySpace?) have died.</p><p>[bctt tweet="Social media advertising has become a key part of most digital strategies. That's why advertisers continue to offer new and innovated products that allow for more precise targeting than ever before. @TimothyTHaines" username="@brightdigit"]</p><h2>What common mistakes do you see people make?</h2><p>Assuming that their working with an expert...</p><ol><li>Putting a bunch of work into something **without an actual strategy**.</li><li><strong>Forgetting to create personas</strong> and consider the needs and pain points of their target audiences.</li><li><strong>Putting quantity over quality.</strong></li></ol><h2>Could you explain exactly how a Facebook pixel works?</h2><p>The Facebook pixel tracks what you do on a specific website and it also tracks what you do on all other website that use a Facebook pixel. <strong>Facebook pixel makes it possible to run extremely advanced campaigns; it is really the technology that makes Facebook advertising so successful.</strong> Facebook is extremely good at figuring out what it is users want to see.</p><h2>How do the changes in 2018 change FB advertising? (FB clamping down on advertisers procuring user data, etc.)</h2><p>The changes in 2018 don't have a dramatic impact on advertisers. Depending on the target audience, some advertisers have had to shift their strategies. However, similar changes have happened before. For example, Facebook removed the ability to target by profession last year. <strong>To keep winning with Facebook ads, it is important to handle data responsibly, create high-quality ads, and to send users to high-quality websites.</strong></p><h2>How are advertising on FaceBook and Instagram different? Similar?</h2><p>As a channel, Instagram is more focused on lifestyle content and is also used by a typically younger demographic (Instagram is highly popular among young adults between the ages of 18 and 29). Ads that perform well on Facebook will not necessarily perform well on Instagram. Having said that, many of the ad units are similar and the targeting itself is the same (the Facebook ads marketplace is used to run ads on both channels).</p><p>[bctt tweet="To keep winning with Facebook ads, it is important to handle data responsibly, create high-quality ads, and to send users to high-quality websites. @TimothyTHaines" username="@brightdigit"]</p><h2>How does one decide which best suits one's business?</h2><p>You must have a digital marketing and content strategy that includes detailed personas then you can worry about content distribution and which channels to focus on. <strong>The strategy should always guide distribution and channels.</strong></p><p>[bctt tweet="The strategy should always guide distribution and channels. @TimothyTHaines" username="@brightdigit"]</p><h2>If I have no interest in social media at all, is it worth doing half-heartedly? Or should I just not do it if I'm not convinced of the value?</h2><p>It's wise to outsource or delegate to another team member if you're not interested in it. <strong>Quality is more important than quantity. Remember that your potential lack of interest doesn't negate the potential return on investment.</strong> For example: I'm not interested much in PR. I just never "fell in love" with it the way that I have fallen in love with digital marketing. My lack of interest in PR doesn't negate the fact that it constantly has a positive impact on my business when I do it well.</p><p><strong>You can either become an expert or hire one.</strong></p><hr><p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-Marketing-Hackers/events/253375863/">Tim will be speaking at WLNS on October 10th at Noon.</a> Please RSVP at our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-Marketing-Hackers/events/253375863/">meetup page.</a> Check out the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/drinksanddigital/">Drinks and Digital Facebook group</a>, for more details on events in your area.</p><p>If you are interested in the technical or advanced side of marketing and want to become a power user in such apps and services then definitely check out <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-Marketing-Hackers/">Lansing Marketing Hackers.</a> <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-Marketing-Hackers/">Lansing Marketing Hackers</a> is a meetup we host with support from <a href="https://unodeuce.com">UnoDeuce Multimedia</a> and <a href="https://www.teksystems.com">TekSystems</a> on the second Wednesday of every other month at Noon.

Here are 5 ways this could affect those with macOS apps already out there:]{style=";"} <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/macOS-Mojave-Screenshot.jpg" alt="desktop screenshot of Mojave for developers"/>{.aligncenter .size-full .wp-image-1289 width="1280" height="800"}</p><h1>Phasing Out 32 Bit Support for Applications</h1><p>[64-bit computers have been around for at least 10 years. However, many older applications are still built with only 32-bit support. This means macOS has had to support both 32-bit and 64-bit apps.Until now.]{style=";"} Apple has announced that <strong>Mojave will be the final OS to support 32-bit. </strong>With this change in Mojave for developers, <strong>you have one year to get ready and update your build</strong> for 10.15, the first 64-bit only OS from Apple. Otherwise your ancient 32-bit app will no longer work in the fall of 2019.</p><h1>Enhanced App Permissions in Mojave for Developers</h1><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-13-at-2.57.43-PM.png"/><p>{.aligncenter .size-full .wp-image-1257 width="1560" height="1370"} macOS Mojave now requires your apps to request permission when using the <strong>camera, microphone, or any automation</strong> (i.e. AppleScript and Apple Events). This means if your app uses any of those functionalities, <strong>you'll need to update your code to ask for those permissions as well as handle when permission is not granted.</strong></p><h1>Dark Mode and Mojave</h1><p>[Dark mode is the ability to change UI to use a more <em>light on dark </em>theme. Developers love this and it can look slick as long as apps are built with this in mind.<strong> To take advatange, developers can look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/supporting_dark_mode_in_your_interface">Apple's documentation</a> on how to support Dark mode.</strong> For websites, make sure your <a href="https://twitter.com/kkuldar/status/1006208146464002049">background color is set properly</a> and stay up to date on possible queries you can add to your styling to keep it looking good in dark mode.]{style=";"}</p><h1>Safari Privacy Features in Mojave</h1><p>[With Mojave, Safari users will have to start explicitly giving permission for certain websites to track them. If you run a website which is using any sort of tracking or pixel targeting, keep note of these changes. You may have to tweak how you track your user interactions for your site.]{style=";"}</p><h1>UIKit Coming to the Mac</h1><p>[caption id="attachment_1285" align="aligncenter" width="896"]<img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-08-06-at-4.35.30-PM-e1533587827702.png" alt="example of "Marzipan" in action on Mojave"/>{.size-full .wp-image-1285 width="896" height="700"} example of "Marzipan" in action on Mojave with the Stocks app[/caption] [UIKit is the framework for developing the user interface of iPhone and iPad apps.

They have also given us a preview in Mojave with apps like Home, Stocks, News and Calculator.

It appears that Apple is addressing concerns from the past year and doing some behind the scenes house cleaning. These behind the scenes improvements might not grab the headlines but they make a big difference for users and businesses.</p><h1>An iOS Update For Everyone</h1><p>Both inside and outside the Apple world, lately there has been a fair share of bad press and scandals. These reports are especially regarding security issues, battery life, speed and bugs. As a result, this year they have delivered the first update in awhile in which devices supporting the previous OS support the update. That means all devices which support iOS 11 can update to iOS 12:</p><h4>iPhone</h4><ul><li>iPhone X</li><li>iPhone 8</li><li>iPhone 8 Plus</li><li>iPhone 7</li><li>iPhone 7 Plus</li><li>iPhone 6s</li><li>iPhone 6s Plus</li><li>iPhone 6</li><li>iPhone 6 Plus</li><li>iPhone SE</li><li>iPhone 5s</li></ul><h4>iPad</h4><ul><li>12.9-inch iPad Pro 2nd generation</li><li>12.9-inch iPad Pro 1st generation</li><li>10.5-inch iPad Pro</li><li>9.7-inch iPad Pro</li><li>iPad 6th generation</li><li>iPad 5th generation</li><li>iPad Air 2</li><li>iPad Air</li><li>iPad mini 4</li><li>iPad mini 3</li><li>iPad mini 2</li></ul><h4>iPod</h4><ul><li>iPod touch 6th generation</li></ul><p>Additionally one piece of news that should make everyone happy is that <a href="https://bgr.com/2018/06/05/ios-12-vs-ios-11-speed-test-iphone-5s-iphone-8/">older devices actually run faster with this update.</a> This means if your company has older iPads, such as the iPad Air, or older iPhones like the iPhone 5s or iPhone 6, it will probably be worth your time to update your devices. <strong>For developers, expect very high adoption rates of iOS 12 and little reason to support iOS 11 for much longer.</strong></p><h1>Mac App Store Improvements</h1><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-07-at-7.39.18-AM-1024x810.jpg"/><p>{.wp-image-1295}</p><p>The Mac App Store has received its fair share of criticism. Compared with its iOS counterpart, it has seemed neglected and insufficient for the macOS software market. Apple has decided this year to make a bigger push towards getting software developers onto the Mac App Store.</p><h2>Better Models For Businesses</h2><p>Not only are they migrating the magazine format from the iOS App Store over to the Mac but there are changes to the restrictions on apps and their business model.</p><p>Recently, Apple has included a better subscription model. And now they are including something like a "Free Trial" offering available from the Mac App Store. There will also be improvements to how sandboxing works. Sandboxing is a way to isolate the app and the files it uses from the rest of the data on your computer. <a href="https://twitter.com/panic/status/1003767077256089600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1003767077256089600&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2018%2F06%2F04%2Fnew-sandboxing-improvements-bring-transmit-back-to-the-mac-app-store%2F">This improvement to sandboxing has allowed Mac developers at Panic to publish their app Transmit to the App Store.</a> As far as their pricing model, Panic will be doing a subscription model on the App Store and allowing a one-time purchase on their website.<br> &gt; The Mac App Store is already home to some of the best apps in the &gt; world. But there's plenty of room for more 😉<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Here are just a few of the awesome developers coming to the all-new &gt; Mac App Store. &gt; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC18?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WWDC18</a> &gt; <a href="https://t.co/UmWZVVDV8U">pic.twitter.com/UmWZVVDV8U</a> &gt; &gt; --- App Store (@AppStore) <a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore/status/1003774653985370112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, &gt; 2018</a></p><p><br>There are also other big software companies moving to the App Store, such as Microsoft and Adobe.</p><p>If you're interested in learning more about macOS development, check out our article on <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2018/02/16/macos-development-ios-developers/">macOS development for iOS developers</a>. Now is a good time to at least consider publishing your app to the mac.</p><h1>Using Social to Showcase AR</h1><p>Since the release of the iPhone X and AR Kit, Apple has continued to showcase it's AR features with Animoji and now Memoji. Animoji would use a set of cute animated characters which mimic your facial expressions using iPhone X technology. With iOS 12, Memoji allows a user to create an animated version of themselves. It's easy to view this as a bit of a gimmick. However, we must keep in mind what is going on "under the hood." Memoji is a way to demo the exciting new AR and machine learning technology behind it.</p><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_4492d8beee0b-1-169x300.jpg" alt="Screen Time in iOS 12"/><p>{.wp-image-1301}</p><p>Businesses should continue to watch trends in ARKit and CoreML and consider how these tools may help their business.</p><h1>Encouraging Productivity</h1><p>Just as Google introduced new ways to control phone usage on Android, Apple is doing the same on iOS 12 with Screen Time. Screen Time allows users (and parents) to limit app and overall phone usage.</p><p>Users can always avoid following through on these limitations by overriding them with a pass code. However, it's important for businesses to keep in mind that users can place these limits on their apps.</p><h1>Plenty For Businesses to Prepare</h1><p>In iOS 12, Apple has introduced Screen Time which encourages associating the iPhone with productivity and less with addictive games and social networking. Apple is also showing their commitment to older devices by making them faster and more reliable in iOS 12. There is a strong indication that Apple sees a big future in the Augmented Realty and Machine Learning space as they introduce more features in ARKit, CoreML, and Memojis.</p><p>On macOS, Apple is encouraging more developers to move to the Mac app store. There are more improvements coming to the new version of macOS, Mojave as well. We will talk about these in <a href="https://brightdigit.com/blog/2018/08/27/5-things-macos-mojave-developers/">our next post</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/iphreaks-podcast-guest</guid><title>iphreaks-podcast-guest</title><description>Leo Dion was a guest on the iPhreaks podcast, discussing MicroConf and building an exercise app for the Apple Watch.</description><link>https://brightdigit.com/articles/iphreaks-podcast-guest</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2018 06:09:00 -0400</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leo Dion from BrightDigit was recently a guest on the <a href="https://devchat.tv/iphreaks/ips-244-microconf-writing-health-apps-for-apple-watch">podcast iPhreaks</a> discussing <a href="https://www.microconf.com/">MicroConf</a>, customer discovery, info products, <a href="https://brightdigit.com/meetups/">meetups</a>, and <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/category/healthkit/">building an exercise app for the Apple Watch</a>.</p><blockquote><p>In today's episode, the iPhreaks panel talk to Leo Dion about MicroConf and writing apps for Apple Watch.

Let's begin a workout and track the user's heart rate with <code>HKLiveWorkoutBuilder</code>. In short, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkliveworkoutbuilder?changes=_9">HKLiveWorkoutBuilder</a> simplifies the way we track health data during workouts.</p><h2>Starting a HKWorkoutSession</h2><p>To start a workout, you'll need the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkhealthstore"><code>HKHealthStore</code></a>, which was <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/healthkit-getting-started/">instantiated in the first step</a>, as well as the <code>HKWorkoutConfiguration</code> which defines the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutconfiguration/1649492-activitytype">activity type</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutconfiguration/1649491-locationtype">location type</a> of the workout you are doing. With those you can create the</p><p><code>HKWorkoutSession</code> with:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> startWorkoutWithHealthStore(<span class="keyword">_</span> healthStore: <span class="type">HKHealthStore</span>,
                                 andActivityType activityType: <span class="type">HKWorkoutActivityType</span>

</code></pre><p>Since this call can throw an error, be sure to catch and handle that error properly. When the workout is completed you simply call <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkhealthstore/1627957-end"><code>session.end()</code></a> to end the workout session.</p><p>To listen to workout state changes, implement the delegate <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutsessiondelegate"><code>HKWorkoutSessionDelegate</code></a> and the method <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutsessiondelegate/1627958-workoutsession"><code>workoutSession(HKWorkoutSession, didChangeTo: HKWorkoutSessionState, fromState: HKWorkoutSessionState, date: Date)</code></a>:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> workoutSession(<span class="keyword">_</span> workoutSession: <span class="type">HKWorkoutSession</span>,

So now that <a href="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/healthkit-getting-started/">authorization is setup on the iPhone,</a> let's take a look at how get authorization setup on the Apple Watch.</p><h2>Authorization on the Apple Watch</h2><p>Just as on the iPhone, the code will be pretty much identical on the Apple Watch when it comes to asking for authorization:</p><p>if HKHealthStore.isHealthDataAvailable() { let healthStore = HKHealthStore() let heartRateQuantityType = HKObjectType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .heartRate)! let allTypes = Set([HKObjectType.workoutType(), heartRateQuantityType ]) healthStore.requestAuthorization(toShare: nil, read: allTypes) { (result, error) in if let error = error { // deal with the error return } guard result else { // deal with the failed request return } // begin any necessary work if needed } }</p><p><strong>However, the Apple Watch does not contain a way for the user to grant access.</strong> So what this method will do is prompt the user to go to their iPhone and grant access. This will be through the Health app as the user did previously on the iPhone example. <img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/06/Simulator-Screen-Shot-Apple-Watch-Series-3-38mm-2018-06-08-at-14.36.24.png"/>{.size-full .wp-image-76 .aligncenter width="272" height="486"} On the iPhone app, a method will need to be implemented in order to listen to this request and prompt the user with the authorization request. This is where</p><p><code>AppDelegate.applicationShouldRequestHealthAuthorization</code> comes in. On the <code>AppDelegate</code>. implement <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622998-applicationshouldrequesthealthau"><code>applicationShouldRequestHealthAuthorization</code></a> and call <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkhealthstore/1614153-handleauthorizationforextension"><code>HKHealthKit.handleAuthorizationForExtension</code></a>.</p><p>@UIApplicationMain class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {</p><p>...</p><p>func applicationShouldRequestHealthAuthorization(_ application: UIApplication) { let healthStore = HKHealthStore() healthStore.handleAuthorizationForExtension { (success, error) -&gt; Void in<br> } } }</p><p>Now whenever the request for authorization is made on the Apple Watch and with new <code>HKObjectType</code> or <code>HKSampleType</code> objects (such as the first time the app is run), the iPhone will prompt the user with the request. [caption id="attachment_89" align="aligncenter" width="640"]<img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/06/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" alt="iPhone and Apple Watch Simulation of Health Data Authorization"/>{.wp-image-89 .size-full width="640" height="640"} this is what it should look like[/caption] After the prompt is completed by the user, the</p><p><code>requestAuthorization</code> callback on the Apple Watch will be called and from there, the usual code can begin.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Apple Watch is a very powerful device for getting health data. To Apple's credit, they are protective of user's data and want to make sure that users are giving that authorization. Since the Apple Watch does not have the UI to grant that authorization, the API requires the Apple Watch to:</p><ul><li>let the user know they need to grant that permission on the iPhone</li><li>prompt the user with the Health authorization dialog on the iPhone</li><li>make the call once the authorization is complete on the iPhone</li><li>handle the result of the authorization from the iPhone on the Apple Watch</li></ul><p>Following these steps correctly and the app can implement a variety of powerful health, workout and fitness features.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/swift-4-2-random-changes-wwdc-2018</guid><title>swift-4-2-random-changes-wwdc-2018</title><description>With WWDC 2018, Swift 4.2 has introduced new ways to generate random values and access random values from a collection.

Often times, app developers will do this when building games or creating test data. Let's take a look at the old way and the new way to access random items.</p><h2>Random Access and Legacy APIs</h2><p>In the beginning, Swift was dependent on old system-level C libraries to generate random numbers. On Apple devices, this is done through the Darwin function <code>arc4random_uniform</code>. While it does do what you want, it requires a lot of work for types besides <code>UInt32</code>. For instance if you need to build a floating-point number, you would need to:</p><p>let minimum = -7.9</p><p>let maximum = 12.8</p><p>let doubleValue = (Double(arc4random<em>uniform(UInt32.max)) / Double(UInt32.max)) </em> (maximum - minimum) + minimum</p><p>This has led several developers to build packages to simplify this process.</p><h2>RandomKit and Simplifying Random Generation</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/nvzqz/RandomKit">RandomKit is one library</a> which has done a great job simplifying that. Each simple type has a static function for generating a value based on a type of generator supplied:</p><p>let value = Int.random(using: &amp;Xoroshiro.default)</p><p>A generator implements the <code>RandomGenerator</code> protocol which provides the implementation needed to generate a value. RandomKit also supplies methods for:</p><ul><li>picking random values from an Array</li><li>shuffling Arrays</li><li>generating other types like Date, (NS/UI)Color, CGPoint and more</li></ul><h2>Swift 4.2 and WWDC 2018</h2><p>Proposal <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0202-random-unification.md">SE-0202</a> seems to be fixing a lot of the inconsistencies which come with random generation and access across operating system (Linux vs macOS) as well as simplifying the API. It also seems to be taking an approach similar to RandomKit. For instance to generate a random Double within a range, all that needs to be done is:</p><p>Double.random(in: -7.9...12.8)</p><p>No more conversions or calculations need to take place. Like RandomKit, a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/randomnumbergenerator"><code>RandomNumberGenerator</code></a> can be supplied as an argument which customizes the way the number is generated. Also like RandomKit, a random element can be selected with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/2994747-randomelement"><code>Array.randomElement</code></a>.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>It seems like a majority of the improvements which were needed for random generation and access have been implemented. There is still room for more complex libraries like RandomKit and the hope is that they implement these new APIs in the future. In the future it's best to use the new APIs and avoid needed the legacy APIs for random number generation in your app or tests.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/healthkit-getting-started</guid><title>healthkit-getting-started</title><description>HealthKit is the most important API when it comes to building health, fitness and workout apps.

HealthKit also has many intricacies and details which need introduction when getting started. The data structures encourage precision while having the flexibility to store a variety of values. The way it asks users give app access HealthKit will probably be similar with many iOS developers. HealthKit follows many patterns in other iOS APIs such as Core Location or Core Data. At the same time it uses newer programming techniques and newer technology.</p><h2>Why I Am Building a Workout App</h2><p>As an independent software developer, exercise is an important part of my schedule. It keeps me healthy, my mind active, and my body stimulated. In order to make the most of my time, I started looking into <strong><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training">High-intensity interval training</a></strong>. <strong>High-intensity interval training</strong> has many benefits but the main strategy is to switch between breif periods of high levels and low levels for an extended period of time. For instance, I've started exercising on the stair stepper for 30 minutes. In that period of time, I'll alternative the speed on the machine to get my heart rate to fluctuate between 150 and 125 beats per minute - for 15 - 30 seconds each. Right now I use the built-in Workout app on my Apple Watch and check my heart rate throughout my exercise. [caption id="attachment_33" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/IMG_208F0706D0D0-1-1024x534.jpeg"/>{.wp-image-33 .size-large width="1024" height="534"} An example of one of my workouts. Notice how fluctuate my heart rate with the intensity of the workout.[/caption] However <strong>a custom app which could notify me of when I reach certain heart rates for a period of time would be better.</strong> As an Apple Watch owner, who has built his fair share of apps for the Apple Watch since day one, this presents itself as a great opportunity to learn more about HealthKit.</p><h2>HealthKit Structure - QuantityTypes and WorkoutTypes</h2><p>One of the key classes in HealthKit is <code>HKObjectType</code>. <code>HKObjectType</code> is the base class which defines different data types. For instance in the case of heart rate, will be a <code>HKQuantitiyType</code> . To access specific types, call</p><p><code>HKQuantity.quantityType(forIdentifier: HKQuantityTypeIdentifier)</code> with the correct <code>HKQuantityTypeIdentifier</code> . For instance to get the heart rate <code>HKQuantityType</code>:</p><p><code>HKObjectType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .heartRate)</code>Another</p><p><code>HKObjectType</code> is <code>HKWorkoutType</code>, which is accessed by calling</p><p><code>HKObjectType.workoutType()</code>. [caption id="attachment_41" align="aligncenter" width="800"]<img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/diagram.png"/>{.wp-image-41 .size-full width="800" height="275"} HKObjectType Hierarchy[/caption] The first thing we are going to use with these types is request permission from the user to read and write to HealthKit.</p><h2>Requesting Authorization in HealthKit</h2><p>One thing Apple tries to do their best at is making sure the user gives permission to various APIs. Just as with location info and notifications, <strong>the user must allow an app permission in order to access HealthKit</strong>. The first thing which needs to be done, is to check if HealthKit is available by calling</p><p><code>HKHealthStore.isHealthDataAvailable()</code>. If HealthKit is unavailable (such as on the IPad), deliver a notice to the user. Next get access to HealthKit via the class, <code>HKHealthStore</code>. Call <code>HKHealthStore()</code> to instantiate an object to use throughout your app. With the</p><p><code>HKHealthStore</code> object, request authorization through the</p><p><code>.requestAuthoriation(toShare:, read:, completion:)</code> method. The</p><p><code>toShare</code> and <code>read</code> parameters take an optional <code>Set</code> of <code>HKSampleType</code> (<code>HKObjectType</code> subclass for data samples) to write and an optional</p><p><code>Set</code> of <code>HKObjectType</code> to read from. [caption id="attachment_42" align="aligncenter" width="505"]<img src="https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Artboard-1-253x300.png"/>{.wp-image-42 width="505" height="600"} Diagram of Requesting Authorization[/caption] <strong>Whenever this method with new</strong></p><p><code>HKObjectType</code> <strong>or</strong> <code>HKSampleType</code> <strong>objects (such as the first time the app is run), the permission screen is shown.</strong> <code>requestAuthoriation</code> is an asynchronous method, which means the <code>completion</code> is called once the request has been completed. The <code>completion</code> closure is where you'd begin to interact with the user and begin queries for data. Let's take a look at how to properly with request authorization.</p><p>if HKHealthStore.isHealthDataAvailable() { let healthStore = HKHealthStore() let heartRateQuantityType = HKObjectType.quantityType(forIdentifier: .heartRate)! let allTypes = Set([HKObjectType.workoutType(), heartRateQuantityType ]) healthStore.requestAuthorization(toShare: nil, read: allTypes) { (result, error) in if let error = error { // deal with the error return } guard result else { // deal with the failed request return } // begin any necessary work if needed } }</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>HealthKit is a complex but an easily workable API for building workout and health app.</p><ul><li><code>HKObjectType</code> - the base class for HealthKit data.</li><li><code>HKHealthStore</code> - the access point for requesting authorization to read and data.</li><li><code>.requestAuthoriation(toShare:, read:, completion:)</code> - requests authorization of what data to read and write on a <code>HKHealthStore</code> object.</li><li>When any change is made to the authorization requested, the permission sheet will show.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/articles/do-i-need-a-website</guid><title>do-i-need-a-website</title><description>Having an updated, easy to navigate website makes a huge difference.

It can be tempting to make the website yourself or perhaps ask a family member to create it for you. However, you will save yourself a lot of trouble in the long run if you hire a professional from the beginning. It is similar to building a house. <strong>If the foundation isn't done correctly, everything else will slowly fall apart and have problems</strong>.

The hope is that iOS developers will be able to bring their apps over to macOS. Of course this can already be done. The question is whether you should migrate your iOS app over, how you can do it, what the future may be for multi-platform iOS macOS apps.</p><h2>Why Should You Get Into Mac Development</h2><p>[There are some very good reasons to get into Mac development if you already are an iOS developer.]{style="font-size: 16px;"}</p><h2><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/discount-383-150x150.png" alt="price tag icon"/>{.alignnone .wp-image-572 .size-thumbnail width="150" height="150"}</h2><h3>Market Potential</h3><p>Many app developers will tell you how difficult it is to get users to find your app, use the app, and then give you money through some means. macOS has a greater expectation that software is less frivolous and therefore can be more expensive. There is some truth to this since if you're already willing to put cash down on an iMac, iMac Pro, or Mac Pro spending money on software would barely be an expense. With that though comes that your software is more than just another social network app or streaming app but a professional application for creating or building something.</p><h2><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/responsive-388-150x150.png" alt="cross apple communication"/>{.alignnone .wp-image-591 .size-thumbnail width="150" height="150"}</h2><h3>Companion App</h3><p>By building a macOS companion app for already existing iOS app, you can reach a whole other market and perhaps earn some credit from the folks at Apple. By having your app in macOS as well you offer more versatility for more complex operations and a more open operating system.</p><h2>How To Get Into Mac Development</h2><h3>Similarities</h3><p>By already being an iOS developer, you already bring a lot to the table when it comes to Mac development. For one thing you don't need to learn a whole new programming language. Whether you develop in Objective-C or Swift, you can bring that with you to Mac development. There are also many frameworks which have common or similar APIs such as Core Data, Core Graphics, CoreML, and more. For more details check out <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/MigratingFromCocoaTouch/MigratingFromCocoaTouch.html">Apple's guide on migration</a>.</p><h3>Differences</h3><p>With API that is at least 10 years older, there's liable to be many differences when it comes to iOS and macOS development. iOS is based around Cocoa Touch with UIKit as the primary UI framework. macOS on the other hand is based around Cocoa and uses AppKit for its UI framework. The main differences come down to methodologies, language support, UX, and hardware.</p><h2><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/uczf1sxcejo.jpg"/>{.size-full .wp-image-178 width="1600" height="1068"}</h2><h4>Methodologies</h4><p>AppKit, the primary UI framework, was originally developed at a time before many modern programming concepts had arrived. So while UIKit uses a Target-Action model, as well, delegates, and closures; AppKit uses mostly Target-Action for method signatures. Another thing is the use of Cocoa Binding for mapping data to controls using key paths. Cocoa Binding is more based around the Model-View-ViewModel pattern as opposed to Model-View-Controller pattern when it comes to displaying model data. While Cocoa Touch has evolved along with Swift much more fluidly, Cocoa, is still restricted by backwards support and being an older framework. <img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Swift_logo_with_text.svg_.png" alt="swift logo"/>{.size-full .wp-image-623 width="640" height="187"}</p><h4>Language Support</h4><p>With Objective-C being the more primary language with AppKit, there is a heavier use of the target-action model, selectors, and accessor methods. Selectors while available in Swift tends to be more awkward in use. Typically UIKit will have selectors but usually have an alternative way as well to respond to events such as delegates and closures. Accessor Methods are used throughout Cocoa and AppKit rather than Properties which are used throughout Cocoa Touch and UIKit. Also the prefixes for many classes use the NextStep prefix "NS-" still rather than the UIKit prefix "UI-".</p><h2><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lilly-rum-342740-425.jpg"/>{.wp-image-621 .size-full width="1920" height="1280"}</h2><h4>Development Workflow</h4><p>There are some things which make developing macOS on macOS hardware. For one thing, there is no need for simulators. However this means you no longer have access to every model which the operating system could be on. This should rarely be an issue but there are times when certain Mac models have differing capabilities and differing speeds. One difference with Macs are the differing screen sizes. Over the years iOS screen sizes have grown in variety quite a bit but macs have a practically infinite possibilities with screen sizes. Of course macOS apps unlike iOS apps don't always run in full-screen.</p><h2><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kaitlyn-baker-422999-409.jpg"/>{.size-full .wp-image-622 width="1920" height="1280"}</h2><h4>Human Computer Interaction</h4><p>With macOS apps running in multiple windows comes a different classic way to interact. With iOS, apps typically have one UIWindow which take up the whole screen however macOS apps have multiple NSWindows which can a wide variety sizes. UIWindow is a subclass of UIView; NSWindow is not a subclass of NSView. Also there are a variety of devices you may need to interact with including the mouse and keyboard. NSEvent along with varying delegate, controller, view, window methods, are the ways you can respond to various mouse and keyboard events. Menus can also be more complex and come in a variety of types such as context menus, pop-up lists, status bar menus, and more. There is also a variety of classes which may sound similar but aren't. One example is NSTableView and UITableView. While UITableView is used for menus, lists, and other purposes in iOS, NSTableView is pretty much a strict table with rows and columns and is used for those purposes. The other major difference is the way documents and the file system is handled. macOS comes with more complex document handling and depending on how your app is setup with sandboxing the user may have differing access to the actual file system.</p><h2><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/vadim-sherbakov-36-437.jpg"/>{.wp-image-619 .size-full width="1920" height="1282"}</h2><h2>Remedies For Porting to macOS</h2><p>There are few method to porting code over from iOS to macOS. All these methods are valid and could be used together in various ways:</p><ul><li>Just Copy the Code</li></ul><ul><li>- more code to maintain<ul><li>most flexible</li><li>least consistent</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Use Lower-Level Common Framework</li></ul><ul><li>- less code to maintain<ul><li>more difficult to provide functionality</li><li>some consistency</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Use Adapter Pattern</li></ul><ul><li>- less code to maintain than copying<ul><li>more consistency with some flexibility</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Preprocessor Directives</li></ul><ul><li>- use for small pieces of code which have little difference (i.e. NSColor / UIColor, etc...)</li></ul><h2><img src="https://brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Marzipan_fruit_with_nervous_expression-430.jpg"/>{.wp-image-618 .size-full width="1920" height="1440"}</h2><h2>What's the Future of macOS Development?</h2><p>With talk about the <em>Marzipan</em> project, which is supposed to unify iOS and macOS development, the question becomes "What is the future of macOS development?".</p><h3>Porting iOS UI to macOS</h3><p>Apple could port classes such as UIViewController to macOS and only make minor modification for macOS. This could mean a jaunty experience on the Mac but the easiest experience for developers.</p><h3>UXKit</h3><p>UXKit, a private framework, used in the development of the Mac Photos app could be made available to the public. The Photos app while visually appealing has received many criticism for its awkward experience on the Mac.</p><h3>Unified Abstract Layer</h3><p>A new framework which abstracts UIKit and AppKit but also offers way to hook into AppKit and UIKit if needed such as the way UIKit or AppKit allow access to Core Graphics. This would offer the most flexibility while removing all of the repetitive code.</p><h3>Similar to watchOS and tvOS</h3><p>Apple may also follow their pattern with watchOS and especially tvOS which have many similar UI type features but also have many differences.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If you are thinking about getting into macOS development, I think now is the best time to do it; especially if you are already an iOS development. It is not something which will be easy however being fluent in Swift or Objective-C and having knowledge of some of the common frameworks used will help. With hopefully whatever the <em>Marzipan</em> project brings will smooth out of the rough and outdated piece of the macOS api but coming with some of that legacy knowledge will help.

Yes it is a iPhone 8 Plus Black with 256 GB. <em>Or</em> You don't have one. Null!</p><hr><p>Now the question is, how do we do null or nil while abstracting away pointers in our programming language.</p><h2>What is Optional?</h2><p>By now, many programming languages have shifted away from using pointers and have simply abstracted them away. At this point, a programmer doesn't really care about what specific address a piece of information is stored at? Typically you want the actual info. The problem then is <strong>how can you signify null while still containing that information and not using pointers. </strong> Most languages assume all objects can be null and should be checked programmatically. However a language like C# doesn't do this with value types (Int, Float, Char, Structs, etc...). It assumes all value type objects are in fact not null and later created Nullable struct to contain value types as well as a boolean to tell whether the object is null or not. In many ways Swift is doing something similar and taking it to the next level. <strong>Swift assumes all objects are not nil and if anything could be it would contained in its own Optional (enumeration) container.</strong> This means any parameter, return value, property, etc... needs to be noted as Optional if that value could ever be nil. Just as C# has a syntax short hand for the Nullable type, Swift does as well using the question mark '?'. Additionally Swift also has a syntax for wrapping and unwrapping these variables as well.</p><h2>Optional Chaining</h2><p>In Swift, you can easily specify that a variable is optional by using the question mark: <code>let x: Foo?</code> In this case, <code>x</code> could contain a Foo or not. What this is called is <strong>wrapping</strong> your variable as optional. So let's say we create a struct for an iOS device:</p><p>struct Device {</p><p>let model: String</p><p>let storage: Int</p><p>let color: UIColor</p><p>}</p><p>Great! Now let's add a static property to get the device information.</p><p>extension struct Device {</p><p>static var current : Device? {</p><p>/// code here</p><p>/// could return nil if the device is not iOS</p><p>}</p><p>}</p><p>Notice this returns an <em>optional</em>. So if you run this code on your Mac or perhaps on Linux, you will get nil. Now, what is nice about Swift is that we have the ability to use optional chaining to get properties. <strong>By using the question mark suffix on a variable, we can safely pull properties from the optional.</strong> Since the variable is optional, that optional gets carried to its properties:</p><p>let model : String? = Device.current?.model</p><p>This optional chaining can be carried through as well. So if the model property were something like this:</p><p>struct Model {</p><p>let frontCameraResolution : CGSize?</p><p>//...</p><p>}</p><p>Then you would do something like this:</p><p>let frontCameraResolution : CGSize? = Device.current?.model?.frontCameraResolution</p><p>So whether you are on a Mac, using Linux, or on an old iPhone with not front-facing camera, your value would be nil. Now it can get tedious many times to use the question mark suffix and perhaps you just need the value if it is there because another method does not take an optional value. In this case you need to unwrap your optional value. <strong>This is where <code>if let</code> and <code>guard let … else</code> statements take over. These provide a safe way to convert your optional to an ordinary value and take care of cases where the optional is nil. This is called conditional unwrapping</strong> The other way and the less safe way is forcible unwrapping and using the exclamation mark.</p><h2>Forcibly Unwrapping</h2><p><strong>Most of the time, it is best to catch instances of nil values and through a better error rather than the default <code>unexpectedly found nil</code> error.</strong> However when you must just force an optional to not be an optional there is a way by using the exclamation mark.</p><p>let model : Model = Device.current!.model</p><p>Now we are using an exclamation mark to force the optional value to be just the value. So if we were to run this on a Mac or Linux, it will crash. <strong>This is typically not recommend. And even if you want it to crash, you may want to do something with that info and create a custom error for to display to the user.</strong></p><h2>Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals</h2><p>Just as a question mark is used for optional chaining, that is chaining an optional value to its properties, as well as declaring a variable to be optional, you can declare a variable as an <strong>Implicitly Unwrapped Optional.</strong> For instance:</p><p>let model : Model! = Device.current?.model // no crash here</p><p>let frontCameraResolution : CGSize = model.frontCameraResolution // will crash here if nil model</p><p>What this means is that <strong>the <code>model</code> variable will be treated as not optional and will not crash here but rather if <code>model</code> is nil and you access a property on it, it will crash.</strong> There is one main case where you will see this: properties which can't be set at initialization but will be set very soon after. The classic example for this is IBOutlets and subviews.</p><p>@IBOutlet weak var subview: UIView!</p><p>If you have a UIViewController which contains a subview property that you've linked in a storyboard and that property cannot be set at initialization but needs to be set afterwards in <code>.viewDidLoad()</code>. You can safely assume that variable will be setup since most of your code will be after <code>.viewDidLoad()</code>. So rather than accessing properties with</p><p><code>self.subview?.property</code> you can access the property by simply typing</p><p><code>self.subview.property</code>.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Swift emphasizes type-safety and Optional are a great example. Getting away from the pointers used in Objective-C, Swift uses optionals to signify whether a value could be nil. The question mark is used for optional chaining to ensure that an optional's properties remain type-safe and returns optional for those properties. Rarely you may want to assume that a optional is never nil, then you have the option to use the exclamation mark to forcible unwrap optionals. You can also treat optionals as unwrapped if they never be nil shortly after initialization such as storyboard linked subview. To do this give the property or variable a exclamation suffix on its type. Ultimately optionals provide a convenient way to keep your code both clean and efficient while being type-safe.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/understanding-optionals-in-swift</guid><title>understanding-optionals-in-swift</title><description></description><link>https://brightdigit.com/tutorials/understanding-optionals-in-swift</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2017 13:38:00 -0500</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Optionals are a fairly unique concept in Swift.

The JavaScript file a.out.js contains a global Module you can then access to call the c methods. However you need the expose the methods you would like to call.

# Interfacing with the code

The a.out.js gives you a variable called **Module**. All Modules have
four methods which are mainly used:

`ccall(functionName, jsReturnType, [jsparameterTypes], [args])`
:   Calls the encapsulated c method. The JavaScript type is either
    number or string.

`cwrap(functionName, jsReturnType, [jsparameterTypes])`
:   Creates a JavaScript method, which can be called directory. It is to
    [bind](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind)
    what ccall is to
    [call](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call).

`getValue(ptr, type)`
:   Gets the value based the pointer.

`setValue(ptr, value, type)`
:   Sets the value based on the pointer. The type must be one of
    i8,i16,i32,i64,float,double or a pointer type like i8 *(or just* )

With our c function looking like:

    char* hello_world () {
     return "hello world!";
    }

We\'ll just use cwrap to create an ordinary JavaScript to call and
return a string.

    return {
      hello : Module.cwrap('hello_world', 'string', [])
    };

Now all we have to do is call `hello_emscripten.hello()` to return the
string. Go [here](http://leogdion.github.io/hello-emscripten/) to look
at the resulting demo. To build the project your self, install the node
modules required and run grunt.

    npm install
    grunt

# Conclusion

Emscripten is powerful tool for taking complex c code and running it in
the browser. There are already [hundreds of
projects](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki#demos) doing the
same thing. Next time I will show how to the
[gmemujs](https://github.com/leogdion/gmemujs) works in playing old
video game music using
[emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten),
[gmemu](https://code.google.com/p/game-music-emu/), and the [Web Audio
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web_Audio_API).]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
