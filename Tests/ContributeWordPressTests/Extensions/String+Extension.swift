  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>This is the first time I’ve done a year in review. It’s a healthy way to look back on what went well and what was challenging. My main goal this year was to produce more content online and less time on local events and gatherings. I removed many things which I felt were a distraction. Instead focused on building habits which would help me to build more content in the future. While many years have presented challenges both personally and professionally, I hoped this year I could focus on that work. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. <strong>Despite many challenges, I would say 2018 was a success in the sense that I was able to prove to myself, what I could do. My hope is that this gives me the momentum to move forward in 2019.</strong></p>

  <h2 id="goals-2018">My Goals for 2018</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>As I said I removed many activities from my life mostly networking and meetups from my schedule. This is because <strong>I am better off showcasing my talent to a wider audience online.</strong> This includes meetups which I no longer related to.</p>

  <h3>Optimizing Meetups in 2018</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>I started two meetups and stopped organizing one. If the meetup was not popular enough or was not an audience which matched my online content audience, I cut it from my schedule.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4>Javascript</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>In 2014, I started Lansing’s first Javascript Meetup along with two of my colleagues. <strong>It was getting audience sizes at the time of 5-15 people. Meanwhile, for instance, the Ruby meetup was getting 20 easily. By the end of 2017, we were getting as many as 30 people to the JavaScript. While many other meetups including Ruby had fizzled out. </strong>Despite this by 2018, I was barely writing JavaScript. Regardless of how much I enjoyed attending, I stepped down from my leadership position in 2018. My focus has shifted more toward Swift development. So it made more sense to start a Cocoaheads meetup. Unfortunately, this did not go as well as I wanted it too.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4>Cocoaheads</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Despite the Apple store being gracious enough to offer the space, we never had much of an audience. Our best event was our Introduction to iPhone Development meetup, which I presented at. Teaching beginner level content in the long term won’t likely draw a long-term audience. Therefore, I put Lansing Cocoaheads on hiatus in 2018. The other meetup I started was Lansing Marketing Hackers and this to me was the biggest surprise.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4><em>Marketing Hackers</em></h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Having attended ReleaseNotes and Microconf, two business/marketing conferences for developers, I saw a gap in the marketing expertise locally. Starting this meetup in Lansing I met three goals:</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul><li>test the demand for this type of marketing content in Lansing</li><li>enrich my own knowledge of the subject, </li><li>meet others interested in this topic set</li></ul>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The meetup would be a new hybrid of marketing and technology. An intermediate level educational networking meetup focusing on how different technologies could help marketing businesses. <strong>Our first meetup only drew 10 people. However, by October of 2018, we were able to grow our attendance to 40 people. </strong>This showed me that there was a demand for this kind of material and event. So of course, I renewed the meetup for the 2018-2019 session. Like so many medium-sized towns, it’s a challenge to get people of out of <g class="gr_ gr_118 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="118" data-gr-id="118">thier</g> home or workplace for lunch. That is what makes Lansing Marketing Hackers a rarity when it came to local networking events.</p>

  <h3>Local Networking in 2018</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>With 5 children under 10 needing to be put to bed every night, it was a heavy load to depend on my wife to do bedtime for all our children. Besides, if the event had little return, I decided to cut it in 2018. On top of this, <strong>if going to an event meant time away from me producing content, it was a distraction.</strong> I think this illustrates a conclusion I learned:</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p><strong>Nobody is looking for an iOS developer at their local networking event.</strong> And while <strong>of course</strong>, I didn’t advertise myself as that necessarily, I did pitch myself as a technical jack-of-all-trades. But I'd need to explain that I am not...</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul><li>your IT Company</li><li>a security expert</li><li>a networking guru</li></ul>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>And the biggest change I made this year was no longer doing web design for businesses and non-profits. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:image {"id":107} -->
  <figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://leogdion.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pexels-photo-326424-e1547232461581-1024x682.jpg" alt="Web Design Tools" class="wp-image-107"/><figcaption>Web Design Tools</figcaption></figure>
  <!-- /wp:image -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Getting Out Of The Web Design Business</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>There is one main reason for this. <strong>In 2018 (and perhaps well before that) the web design business has matured to a point where the market demands more than a simple website design</strong> (ie. analytics, copywriting, marketing, graphics design, etc…). <strong>The other side of that is that whatever potential customers do remain they do not place a high priority on web design.</strong>&nbsp;I&nbsp;was&nbsp;either&nbsp;competing&nbsp;with well-established marketing businesses or services which come with good enough templates.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Therefore it put me at a disadvantage of building a product that I was not proud of and barely bringing in revenue or to commit more time, additional money, and project risk into building an agency which I frankly have no desire or ability to do at this time. <strong>It is better for me to establish myself as an expert in a particular technology so that I have a product to sell which is my knowledge (ebook, video, etc…) and it offers a glimpse to a potential client of what I can provide.</strong></p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:image {"id":108} -->

  <!-- /wp:image -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Being a Swift Expert</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>I never hated Objective-C, Apple’s first primary language for development, however I could definitely tell this was a programming language from the 1980s propped up over time by 2000s programming paradigms syntaxes. Swift was Apple’s solution to both bringing developers who hated Objective-C over and allow for more modern paradigms to take hold.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Since the beginning, I made sure to deep dive and learn as much as I can in the language since it was so green. That meant how Swift could be used by different devices, different APIs, and different programming concepts available. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4>Building Swift <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Content (opens in a new tab)" href="http://learningswift.brightdigit.com" target="_blank">Content&nbsp;in&nbsp;2018</a></h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>I needed to choose something:</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul><li> I enjoyed working with</li><li>there’s enough of an audience interested</li><li>there’s still room for more content in the subject</li></ul>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>So there were three sources for content I’d produce:</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
  <ol><li>Blog about what <strong>I am building </strong><br>The market is flooded with iOS blog posts. I was actually using Swift to build a macOS app. This puts me in a unique position of knowing what I am talking and producing content that is rare and which has an audience.</li><li>Blog about what <strong>people are asking about</strong> <br>This means search forums, Q&amp;As, and other communities on the web and if I saw a question I knew the answer to, I’d write a blog post on it.</li><li>Blog about some new feature, technology, API, etc..<br>I especially took advantage of this after WWDC in 2018, Apple’s developer conference.</li></ol>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The sweet spot was something new, that I was interested in, and was asked about frequently on the web. I wasn’t only doing written content. I made a habit of recording myself presenting at meetups. <strong>This was content I could share and attach to my brand. This would also include other non-written content such as podcasts, videos, and streaming.</strong></p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:image {"id":111} -->

  <!-- /wp:image -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3><em>Other Content</em></h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>I could see the writing on the wall that podcasts are an ever-increasing media consumed by more and more people. Like all the new things, I wanted to know the challenges and quirks of producing that content and get into the habit of doing it. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4><a href="https://okproductive.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OK Productive (opens in a new tab)">OK Productive</a></h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>At the end of 2017, Erik Gillespie and I started our first podcast <a href="#">OKProductive</a>. We came up with the idea of doing a productivity podcast because it was something we were both interested in but also felt that <strong>many podcasts in the area of personal productivity are obsessed with optimizing every aspect of daily life in an almost clinical way - think of the difference between a photo you’d see in a furniture catalog of a living room and a real organized room - one looks gorgeous but is absolutely impractical, the other is slightly messy at times but practical and comfortable.</strong></p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>We set a regular schedule throughout 2018 for recording podcast and to regularly chat about topics and share notes. Overall producing OKProductive was an enjoyable and educational experience. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work with such a great co-host. From there, I then went on to start another podcast in 2018 - this would be for my business BrightDigit - <a href="#">EmpowerApps.Show</a>.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4><a href="#">EmpowerApps.Show</a></h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>With help from Theresa Jasko my co-host, we created a regular schedule and workflow of notes, recording, and blog posts. The podcast focuses on businesses which use Apple devices and want to learn more about how the ecosystem works as well as what’s new.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>I also began to stream both professionally and personally (i.e. video games). Like I said in the section about Swift if I spoke publicly I recorded it and posted it online (such as <a rel="noopener" href="https://leogdion.name/2018/12/13/are-we-there-yet/">when I spoke at LSJ Storytellers on my family's story</a>). Again the emphasis was more on habit and getting comfortable with the process than on audience building necessarily.</p>

  <!-- wp:heading -->
  <h2 id="obstacles-2018">Unfortunate Obstacles of 2018</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>If there was ever a theme for last year it was that <strong>life happens</strong>. Previous years dealing with a pregnancy, foster care system, the anxiousness of knowing whether you’d keep a child for life or temporarily, the death of a parent, and the threatening of lawsuits by notorious clients were all issues I had dealt with in the past five years - 2018 was going to be the easy year. <strong>However the very day our last foster child was adopted, my dad was scheduled for surgery - this should have been a clear omen of what 2018 would bring.</strong></p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Family Health Issues</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p><strong>I had to take my father to the hospital emergency room several times throughout the year.</strong> Dealing with the healthcare system, incompetent health care professionals, and my poor dad’s challenges, made it difficult to optimize my content production in any sense of the word. On a given day where I planned to do notes for a podcast, I’d have to drop everything. When I was coming back on a red-eye flight from a conference in Las Vegas, I'd have to take my dad to the hospital because he was in paralyzing pain and needed to be taken to the ER. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>My expectation was that I would be able to produce more content this year than I did and I fell short. <strong>My point is not for pity but rather to point out the fact that life does happen and no amount of preparation in life can ensure your ability to be as productive as you want to - you don’t know what you don’t know.</strong></p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>TMJ</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>On top of this, the years of sitting and working at a laptop introduced me to temporomandibular joint pain or <strong><em>TMJ</em></strong>. The pounding feeling of pain at the sides of my head made it difficult for me to focus on the work I wanted to focus on. I had dealt with lower back in the past and have been able to maneuver my life such that I see it as fully managed now. I believe I am getting a better grasp now of how to deal with this and I am hoping to continue to make those changes to my life.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p><strong>An observation about myself is that when stress and pain is piled on my ability to simply write content is seriously diminished.</strong> Quite frankly in those times, it was writing code which became my relaxing work and fed my desire to build. At the end of the day, I would take much pride in the ability to build something cool but there was no audience I had built up yet to engage with. This is why building content was my primary goal of the year.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Finding Balance</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The pain and stress taught me if there’s anything I’ve learned from this year is that <strong>work is not my life but simply a part of my life.</strong> Right now with a living parent, helpful relatives and in-laws, adorable nephews and nieces nearby, 5 beautiful children and the best wife anyone could ask; I consistently can’t see myself looking back and wishing I had done things differently and sacrificed my relationships for my work. I want to treasure every moment now that I can especially as I creep closer to 40.</p>

  <h2 id="2019-changes">Changes for 2019</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>I made the effort to <a href="#">schedule every hour of my day as much as possible according to what my goals are</a>. <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">Unfortunately</g> with the challenges I faced and the realities of who I am, I simply could not write a blog post from my dad’s hospital bed on my laptop while dealing with a throbbing headache. <strong>I am going to be more honest and flexible with my actual schedule day-to-day rather than optimizing to the minute.</strong></p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p><strong>Audience building more than forming habits will be my goal for 2019.</strong> That means more research into what my audience wants rather than just what I want to produce.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>OK Productive</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>When it comes to podcasting especially with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OKProductive (opens in a new tab)" href="http://okproductive.com" target="_blank">OKProductive</a> I have a better grasp of what may be more enjoyable to produce - shorter more diverse content. Previously, each <a href="http://okproductive.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OKProductive (opens in a new tab)">OKProductive</a> podcast episode would focus on one topic for as much as 50 minutes. For instance, an entire podcast episode would focus on sleeping for perhaps 50 minutes. That’s too much for an audience. Rather <strong>I’d like to produce a <g class="gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="11" data-gr-id="11">30 minute</g> episode with three parts, include more humor and small-talk, and really hone the content of the episode.</strong></p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Email</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p><g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">Email</g> will also be a much more key component in my communications this year. Through the years it has been shown to be reliable and more personal means of communication regardless of social media’s growth. Of course, being able to balance consuming social media while also posting to social media as a regular practice will always be a challenge but the fact of the matter is that email will always be a great way to communicate with people.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Focus On The Audience</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p><strong>My primary goal is to pre-sell a product (most likely an info product) by the first half of 2019.</strong> This means focusing more on audience building rather than forming the habits of building content. I am hoping by the middle of the year to be able to look back on this post and see how things went and what I didn’t foresee as obstacles.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Public Speaking</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>As far as attending development conferences, I’d like to focus on speaking at them. Business and marketing focused conferences are much more likely to provide info valuable to me which is why I’ll be attending conferences like Microconf and Peers.</p>

  <h2 id="2019-obstacles">Things to Watch Out For</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>There a few things I am concerned about in 2019 as far as what I can achieve and whether I will be profitable enough. I am hoping this will actually be the quieter of years as far as personal and family issues and give me more breathing room to achieve what I need to do. However I need to always make room for that in my goals and make sure I accept the challenges life throws at it.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>I need to make sure I keep my sales pipeline going while also focusing on content. While building an audience is my primary goal, I need money and <strong>building an audience frankly takes time.</strong> I’ll need to balance the immediate goal of profit while the long term goal of building a product.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>My other worry is whether <strong>investing in being an expert in the Swift space in the long term is the right choice.</strong> Will Apple continue to foster the community? Is there a chance of Swift growing outside of the Apple space? Is Swift limited to only iOS development still? Will other mobile development methods such as React Native, NativeScript, Ionic, etc… over take native development in Swift? Will the mobile app market app become more and more consolidated? These are all things which could affect the Swift info product space and affect me in the long term. We’ll see where this goes in 2019.</p>

  <p>I want to thank and mention the things which helped in more than anything else in 2019.

  <h3>Collaborators and Partners</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>My goal in 2017 was to make sure I began delegating more and more of my work to reduce dependencies on me and this was a very helpful practice to continue. My co-hosts, Theresa and Erik on our respective podcast helped me stay on task and continue keep momentum going. With my meetups as well, I got the help of others like Paul and Chad to continue to grow Lansing Marketing Hackers. I continued to also hire subcontractors on projects where needed as well and I am hoping to continue this where I can. I often see people doing it all themselves - <strong>including others help reduce dependency on you and allows others to be stake-holders in the process.</strong></p>

  <p>I also can’t say enough about the importance of finding folks smarter than you where you can throw your ideas at.

  <h3>Family</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Last but not least is my wife Betsy, who has been my everything this year. When things got rough, she was able to provide the support I needed to keep going. When there were times I simply needed to focus and get something done she provided it. When I need someone to talk to and throw an idea at (bad or good), she was honest and encouraging. <strong>I can’t say how important it was to be on the same page with my significant other when it comes to running a business and we have continued to go through this journey together.</strong> I am looking forward to taking the whole family to New Orleans this year as well as going to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Peers conference (opens in a new tab)" href="http://peersconf.com" target="_blank">Peers conference</a>. <strong>Integrating family time with business is a challenge but also a goal very important to me.</strong></p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>2018 was a challenging year made easier by a support network but also proved to me that I can continue on this path of being self-employed. Many businesses fail at their fifth year and this was my sixth. This year continued my trend away from simply being a freelancer. <strong>I am hoping to have continued focus and confidence in what I need to do to be sustainable but also humbled by the fact that life happens and I need to be flexible.</strong> &nbsp;We will see what 2019 brings and if growth happens in the areas I’d like to see. Stay tuned!</p>

  <li>Learn To Play the Piano</li>

What these really are are the <em>results</em> you want by the end of the year. Today I want to break down these <em>results</em> into actual committed actions.<!--more--></p>

  <figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><img src="https://leogdion.name/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/diagram-for-goals-e1535132251116.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18"/></figure>
  <!-- /wp:image -->

  <h2>Making Results Actionable</h2>
  <p>First thing you need to do is break these down into actual actions. Ask yourself what actions you need to do to achieve those results:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Lose Weight
  <ul>
  <li>Exercise</li>
  <li>Diet</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Publish Book
  <ul>
  <li>Write</li>
  <li>Research Publishing</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Learn to Play the Piano
  <ul>
  <li>Take a class</li>
  <li>Practice</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are things you can actual <strong>do</strong>. Losing Weight for instance is a complex problem requirement many habits and lifestyle changes.<br>Now that you have actual actions, you <strong>need</strong> to allocate time to commit to these.</p>
  <h2>Scheduling Actions</h2>
  <p>There are two reasons to schedule your actions this:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>You make sure nothing short of an emergency will prevent you from doing those things.</li>
  <li>You can see whether those actions are in fact achievable.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This helps you understand what you can actually do and it forces you to budget your time accordingly. So actions now become part your schedule:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Exercise becomes <strong>Exercise between 6am - 8am every Monday, Wednesday, Friday</strong></li>
  <li>Write becomes <strong>Write between 9am - 11am every Thursday</strong></li>
  <li>Practice becomes <strong>Practice Playing the Piano every Monday and Thursday from 8pm - 9pm</strong></li>
  <li>Research Publishing becomes <strong>Research Publishing next Tuesday from 2pm-4pm</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are of course weeks where the schedule may not work out perfectly but you can always move a specific appointment to a different time. The important thing to make sure you are committing to that amount of time either total over the whole period or per week if something which is recurring (exercise, writing, etc...).</p>
  <h2>Dealing with Ambiguous Actions</h2>
  <p>If an action has an indeterminate amount time; It may still be too ambiguous, complex, abstract or unachievable. There are several ways to fix this:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Break the action down even further into sub-actions or steps.
  <ul>
  <li>Research Publishing
  <ul>
  <li>List Publishing Platforms</li>
  <li>Compare Platforms on List</li>
  <li>Make Decision Based on Comparison</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be as specific as possible for those actions:
  <ul>
  <li>Research Publishing
  <ul>
  <li>List 7 Online Publishing Platforms</li>
  <li>Compare Platforms on List based on Price, Formats, and Compatibility</li>
  <li>Sign up for the Publishing Platform Based on Comparison</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Schedule a specific time to complete the task
  <ul>
  <li>Research Publishing
  <ul>
  <li>List 5-7 Online Publishing Platforms on Monday from 3pm - 5pm</li>
  <li>Compare Platforms on List based on Price, Formats, and Compatibility from 8am - Noon on Thursday</li>
  <li>Sign up for the Publishing Platform Based on Comparison from 8am - Noon on Next Tuesday</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the task isn’t completed, you have the choice the decide to allocate more time after or quit and realize your goal may not be achievable. The quicker you quit one goal - the more you have time to achieve another. Don’t fall for the Sunk Cost Fallacy.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>For 2018, you have the ability to make things actually happen. Follow these simple rules:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Break down your goals into more as specific an action as possible</li>
  <li>Use your calendar to schedule time for specific actions</li>
  <li>If you don’t know how much time to allocate repeat process of breaking down action into more specific sub-actiosn</li>
  <li>If you still can’t allocate time, cap the action to a specific time.</li>
  <li>If you can’t complete the action in that time, make a decision to quit and allocate time further.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="why-should-you-start-a-podcast">Why Should You Start a Podcast?</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Podcasting may sound simple at first but to really be successful at it you need perseverance. Therefore, you need to really have a good reason and passion to do for a while. For this reason, rather than discussing <strong>how to start podcast</strong> let’s discuss the why.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3 id="promote-yourself-and-your-skills">Promote Yourself and Your Skills</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Most importantly, sharing your expertise on the web provides a great example to others. However, more so than a written format, talking about a topic is a more natural means for people. Uniquely, rather than giving a talk to 40 people, podcasting allows you to present on topic many times over. In addition, not only can you sell yourself but a product as well.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3 id="sell-a-product">Sell A Product</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Podcasting can be a great way to sell your products. By starting a podcast, you can give your products a narrative and showcase as to how they are helpful. However, <strong>the most important part of selling anything on the web is to provide actual informative valuable content.</strong> Don’t just sell but provide advice - You build trust as well as true expertise on the product’s subject matter.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3 id="enjoy-a-topic-or-hobby-through-podcasting">Enjoy a Topic or Hobby through Podcasting</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>While selling yourself or your products are good reasons, you need to have some sense of enjoyment or passion to really carry out the momentum of producing a podcast show.  Recently on Pat Flynn’s Smart Passive Income podcast,<a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/podcasts/how-powerhouse-youtuber-marques-brownlee-mkbhd-grew-his-massive-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" he interviewed MKBHD (opens in a new tab)"> he interviewed MKBHD</a>, a YouTube tech reviewer with over 8 million subscribers. <strong>MKBHD revealed on the show he produced 100 videos before he even had 100 subscribers.</strong> Building an audience with your show is going to be a long and slow process. For this reason, having enjoyment and passion in podcasting will give you the momentum to carry it through that long process. As a result, if you do decide to start a show though, it’s important to know where to start.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-get-started-podcasting">How To Get Started Podcasting?</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Podcasting involves five components: <strong>content, organization, audio, hosting, and reaching your audience</strong>. With this in mind, having engaging content is perhaps the most important.</p>

  <h3 id="building-content">Building Content</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Based on why you starting your podcast and the type of show you are doing, you need to build a list of topics for your show. With this intention, you need build on your existing expertise and passion while also finding your audience and seeking their pain points.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4 id="build-on-your-existing-expertise-and-passion">Build On Your Existing Expertise and Passion</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>As a result, by building on your passion and expertise, you sound natural and engaging. Nevertheless, if you get stuck compiling a list of topics based on your expertise alone, you can look to your potential audience online. Additionally your audience online will give you insight into their questions or challenges.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4 id="find-your-audience-and-their-challenges">Find Your Audience and Their Challenges</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The web is a great way to reach your audience but it’s also a great way for you to find your audience and the challenges they face. For example, Reddit, Quora, Stackoverflow, Slack Workspace, Youtube Comments, Twitter, Facebook Groups, and any website forum - as long as there is engagement there - is a great opportunity to see what your audience is facing as far as difficulties and where their pain is. They don’t need to be listeners of your podcast already - they just need to be the people you are targeting.  Along with your knowledge, you should have enough content to get started. The important thing is to keep that content organized.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:image {"id":194,"width":1024,"height":514} -->
  <figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://leogdion.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/samuel-zeller-360588-unsplash-703-e1560428158796.jpeg" alt="Organizing Your Production" class="wp-image-194" width="1024" height="514"/></figure>
  <!-- /wp:image -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3 id="staying-organized">Staying Organized</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>There are two key components to staying organized with your podcast: having prepared notes before you record and having a consistent recording and publishing schedule.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4 id="have-prepared-notes-before-you-record">Have Prepared Notes  Before You Record</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Behind the scenes of every great show are some sort of notes when it comes to the topic of each episode. Moreover, even when talking off-the-cuff, it’s important to have anchor points for your discussion. Furthermore, some shows even go so far so to have a complete script. In the end, it really depends on you and the type of show you are producing. Most importantly, the worst flaw is losing your train of thought and having <strong>not enough to talk about.</strong> Therefore, the most natural way of doing this is by talking about what you are an expert at and passionate about. As a result, there are several methods of breaking down any topic into prepared notes:</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul><li>5 W’s - Who, What, Where, Why, HoW</li><li>Chronological Narrative</li><li>Essay Format - Thesis Statement with Three Points</li></ul>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>With this in mind, whatever format you choose make sure you have a structure and stick with it. If your content has structure, it  will give your audience an easier way to organize the content and make it memorable. In addition, building these pre-show notes are a great way to indicate to yourself that you have enough content. Afterwards, these pre-show notes give you an skeleton you will fill in later for the show notes which will be posted publicly with your episode’s metadata. For example, check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQlL4J06mtBQDlc5JJuWxd1k7gLshk4wsyy-CPqFypSJ_I29UUZnqwmTADXh448_YsfcqYgGYLDsWOy/pub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this sample from the episodes Erik and I did for OK Productive on the book Atomic Habits by James Clear (opens in a new tab)">this sample from the episodes Erik and I did for OK Productive on the book Atomic Habits by James Clear</a>. In the same way pre-show notes give you a skeleton to work with, consistency in your schedule can help continue your show’s momentum.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4 id="have-a-consistent-schedule">Have A Consistent Schedule</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Having a consistent schedule, both in recording and publishing, sets your audience expectations and makes sure you build a habit and flow with recording. For example, what I do set aside every Thursday morning to record an episode of each of my podcasts and publish every other week each podcast. By doing this, I have built a habit and expectation on my part that I’ll record every week. Additionally, with the recording to publishing ratio being 2:1, I have now a buffer of episodes, in case something happens: sickness, vacation, etc…. As far as publishing, I have a pretty consistent schedule, publishing every Saturday night or early Sunday morning. Based on playing around with different days, it seems most folks download episodes at the beginning of the work week. This could differ with your audience but clearly setting those expectations are helpful to your audience. Now that we have pre-episode notes and a regular recording schedule, let’s talk about recording.</p>

  <h3 id="working-with-audio">Working with Audio</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The most technical aspect of podcasting is recording and editing your episode. However before we began, I want to reiterate one point: <strong>don’t sink money in the best equipment until you are sure that you’ll stick with podcasting</strong>. Surprisingly, you may already have much of the equipment and there is plenty of free software to do this. As a result, I’d recommend spending some money on better equipment and software perhaps around the 6 month - 9 month time range or once you’ve recorded approximately 10 - 12 episodes and have a rhythm in your schedule. Firstly, the equipment which takes in your voice before anything else is going to be your microphone.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4 id="your-podcasting-microphone"> Your Podcasting Microphone</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Your microphone is going to be your first connection to your audience. When first starting off, I’d recommend using a microphone - any microphone. Most importantly, don’t rely on your laptop microphone and webcam microphone for your audio. In addition, test your audio recording before moving to an editing phase. As far as microphone upgrades, the next step is spending money ($50 - $99) on something like what I use: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QJOZS4/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_mPKRCbM5KJ91F">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB</a> In addition, they also sell a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MSQFIRE/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">combo which include a pop filter and studio</a>, that I use and highly recommend. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Once you’ve reached a point where you wish to go even more professional, you’ll want to look a more expensive microphones and a mixer/pre-amp. These will give an even better sound, more control, and better realtime feedback of your audio. Here are some links which you might find helpful:</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul><li><a href="https://transistor.fm/how-to-start-a-podcast/">Transistor.FM - How to start a podcast</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/equipment/the-best-podcasting-microphones-on-the-market/">The Best Podcast Microphones on the Market</a></li><li><a href="https://discoverpods.com/best-podcast-mic-podcasting-microphone/">25 of the Best Podcast Microphones For Any Budget</a></li></ul>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Therefore, once you have a good microphone for recording, you’ll need software to record your audio.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4 id="recording-and-editing-your-audio">Recording and Editing Your Audio</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Recording software can be fairly simple and inexpensive. For example, there’s free software such as <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Garageband (opens in a new tab)">Garageband</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Audacity (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.audacityteam.org" target="_blank">Audacity</a> for macOS and Windows/Linux respectively. However, if you are planning to edit your podcast then it maybe worth your money to purchase something like: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Apple’s Logic Pro (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/" target="_blank">Apple’s Logic Pro</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Adobe Audition (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html" target="_blank">Adobe Audition</a> which give you more granular control over editing functionality. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
  <h5 id="remote-interviews">Remote Interviews</h5>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Specifically, remote interviews can present its fair share of challenges. For example there are recording apps such as <a href="https://zencastr.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Zencaster (opens in a new tab)">Zencaster</a> which specialize in this. Additionally, you could also record your interview over a conferencing service like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Zoom (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zoom.us" target="_blank">Zoom</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Google Hangouts (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hangouts.google.com" target="_blank">Google Hangouts</a> strip the audio portion and turn that into an episode. Surprisingly though, the conferencing choice of most podcasters is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Skype (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.skype.com/" target="_blank">Skype</a>. However you’ll want to record you and your interviewee on separate tracks. For instance as a macOS user, I use Soundflower to map my audio channels properly (i.e. my microphone and Skype audio to separate tracks). Furthermore, I also encourage my guest to record there own audio since sound quality via Skype isn’t the best.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
  <h5 id="editing-audio">Editing Audio</h5>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Therefore, once you’ve recorded your audio, the next step is editing. Most importantly, having a great recording helps increase the quality of the recording overall. That is to say avoiding filler words, dead air, and meandering rants will improve the quality over any recording. However, in the end, editing will typically be needed. With editing, you want to make sure your sound is clear (and there are a variety of filters to do this). </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Editing can also be the most time consuming. For this reason, I’ve started <a href="https://www.podcastedition.com">outsourcing my editing</a>. Another alternative is using something like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://descript.com/" target="_blank">Descript</a>, a next-generation audio/video editing platform. I primarily use it for transcribing episodes but it’s actually capable of doing full audio and video editing. Lastly, we’ll need to export the file.</p>

  <h4 id="exporting-and-tagging-your-files">Exporting and Tagging Your Files</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>An often forgotten step is including helpful metadata and proper formatting of the resulting mp3 file. Therefore, include the correct podcasting metadata and be sure to export as a mono 64kpbs mp3 file. Luckily, most editing tools provide a means to attach metadata such as podcast title, episode title, summary, and chapters with your episode. In the end, you’ll have your brand new episode as an mp3 file. The question then becomes where to upload your file.</p>

  <p>Hosting your show can tend to be a bit of a maze:</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul><li>a place to put your mp3 file</li><li>a place to host your show’s website</li><li>a way to broadcast to various MP3 players</li></ul>

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4 id="hosting-your-mp3-files">Hosting Your Mp3 Files</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>First thing first, do not try to host your own mp3 files. In contract to simple web pages, these can take several MBs of data and when as many as a hundred people are downloading your episodes you can be bitten by download limits, speed issues, and various other issues. For example, when I first started out, I hosted the website on Wordpress and the mp3 files on Amazon S3. In reality, this involved a lot of manual processes with each episode. Therefore, once my Wordpress sites were hacked, I knew I had transition to a dedicated podcast hosting provider. As a result, I moved to <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=leo">Transistor</a>, which has worked out fantastically. Other services which do this are:</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Significantly, remember with all these hosts, there could be download caps, ad insertion, speed throttling and more which could hinderacne your experience. In the end you’ll get what you pay for. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Be that as it may, each host will provide a place to upload your mp3 files, provide additional metadata, as well as more elaborate public show notes (as opposed to the pre-show notes you use for talking points). In the end you should have a publicly available RSS feed for your show.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4 id="publishing-to-the-web">Publishing to the Web</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>As far a website, services like <a href="https://transistor.fm/?via=leo">Transistor</a>, come with a website of some sort and other services like Blubrry integrate with Wordpress. However what’s even more important than a website is making sure your audio is delivered to the numerous podcast clients. Therefore, each podcasting host will deliver an RSS feed which contains metadata about the show as well as continually updated list of episodes. As as result, you’ll use this to <em>claim ownership of your podcast</em>. Consequently, before submitting, make sure you have <strong>at the very least 3 episodes uploaded as well as a correct author email address setup with your podcast host</strong>.  With this in mind,  while most clients let you manually add RSS feeds, most users will expect to find your show by searching. Therefore, here is a brief list of clients and how to get your show posted there: </p>

  <p>Most importantly, for many of these services, it could take days for submission to work. Surprisingly, some clients like iTunes Connect, actually mirror, or download and re-host your podcast on their platform. Additionally, if you are interested in reaching Alexa, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrgWN6zEQtA&amp;t=1s">this talk I hosted recently where Paul Schmidt talks about turning podcast episodes into Alexa skills</a>.

  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Congrats on getting your show recorded, edited, and hosted. However the real challenge in podcasting comes from growing your audience. In that case, part of that is SEO tricks which can take advantage of Google and various podcast clients. Rather, you can go back to how you found your audience earlier and answer those questions with summaries and subscribable links to your episodes. By this means,  you can realiably reach your audience directly.</p>

  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Social media has its advantages and disadvantages. However, if you don’t have an existing audience, it can lead to not much return on your time. Nevertheless if you do post to social media, make sure it’s a platform your audience uses. For instance, converting 30 second clips into videos are a great way to capture your audiences attention. Such as, <a href="https://gist.github.com/leogdion/2e5f9b8311d6ecdc8c8202eadba0861d">this script I have written to convert 30 second mp3 files into videos for social media</a>. Additionally, Erik, my OK Productive co-host and I use tools like <a href="https://buffer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Buffer (opens in a new tab)">Buffer</a> to automate the process. Surprisingly, the other way to reach your audience is by an email newsletter.</p>

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Email may seem antiquated but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/technology/new-social-network-email-newsletter.html">newsletters are more guaranteed to reach your audience then any social media channel.</a> Accordingly, with email addresses, you can also directly reach your audience and get their feedback. As a result, once you have enough of a large audience, you begin to focus other written content as well and gauge interest accordingly.  </p>

  <p>Now you have a roadmap for discerning and getting started podcasting - from idea to publishing. Firstly, before jumping in, make sure the audience is there as well as your passion and expertise on the topic. Most importantly, have basic recording equipment and test recording an episode before posting. At the same time, begin having talking points and a schedule for recording. Consequently, find a good hosting provider for your mp3 and make sure to export in the correct format. As soon as, you have at least 3 episodes posted to your host, publish your RSS feed to various services. As a result, share your episodes on social media, in various audience websites and forums, and perhaps start an email newsletter to keep your subscribers in touch. to sum up, while podcasting is work, it can be lots of fun. Most importantly, you can always put in as much work as wish. If you have any questions, please be sure to reach out to me. I’d love to hear your podcasting stories and lessons you’ve learned.</p>

  <p>As a software developer who’s transitioned to many roles as a self-employed freelancer, it’s important to keep a set of great software tools. Most importantly tools which help me optimize rather than distract me. Therefore, here’s a list of productivity apps and services I use to keep my workflow going. In contrast, these are not development tools necessarily but rather software which helps with other <em>office</em> work which I do. To begin with, you’ll need an easy way to install, run, and track your application as well as your computer’s disk space.</p>

  <h2>Managing Productivity Apps and Disk</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>For many developers, we live in the command line. Therefore, using a package manager is a great way to install apps without the need to load a distracting web page. For instance, on Linux there’s <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Apt#How%5C_to%5C_use.3F">apt</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum%5C_(software)">yum</a>; Windows has <a href="https://chocolatey.org">Chocolatey</a> and on the Mac is <a title="Homebrew" href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> which is what I use. Altogether, this allows you also to track what you have installed especially using <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle">Homebrew Bundle</a>. Outside of the Mac App Store, Homebrew is a great way to install and manage your productivity apps.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Secondly, one of the first apps I install on my Mac is <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/?ref=okproductive">Alfred</a>. In essence, Alfred not only is superior to the Spotlight search but also offers a plethoria of different services you can integrate with. Thereupon, you can simply map a hot key to that service and it’ll allow you to search for apps, contacts, do math problems, or give you directions. </p>

  <!-- /wp:html -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>While installing all of your productivity apps, you may need to watch your disk space. That’s where <a href="http://cl.ly/ehYa?ref=empowerapps">Daisydisk</a> comes in. In short, DaisyDisk gives you great visualization of how your disk space is used as well as how to cleanup your disk. In contrast to tracking your disk space, let’s talk about a real productivity challenge - tracking your time.</p>

  <h2>Time Tracking and Scheduling Apps</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>With many of my clients and partners, I need to schedule meetings and track my time. Specifically, there’s one app I use for arranging meetings - that is <a href="https://doodle.com/">Doodle</a>. That is to say, Doodle is a platform which allows for easy polling and basic surveys including scheduling. For instance, I can easily share a poll which asks participants the best time to meet from a set of times available. Once votes are placed, I can send them an invite easily. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>As far as tracking my time, I currently use <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>. Generally speaking, Toggl doesn’t come with a lot of bells and whistles, however its open API and simplicity make it ideal for reporting and tracking.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:image {"id":256,"align":"center","width":1024,"height":512} -->

  <!-- wp:heading -->
  <h2>Reminders and Todo List Productivity Apps</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>For tracking my tasks, currently I use a combination of weekly Spreadsheets and <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist.</a> In particular, Todoist offers the ability to share tasks easily with others whether it’s a podcast episode I am working on or a shopping list with my wife. Additionally, I can easily group tasks as well set priorities and due dates.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:html -->

  <!-- /wp:html -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Conversely I also use spreadsheets to track my weekly items.  (I use Numbers - of course you can use Excel or Google Sheets)  As an example I simply add the name of the task (<em>Write a Development Tools</em>) and assign a priority and desire between 0-100 (99) as well as approximate minutes (3 hours?). Lastly, I sort by priority and desire and then based on my availability, work on the top items for that week. Then, each week I copy the sheet into a new one, delete the completed items, copy the old priorities over, set new priorities for the week, and repeat. </p>

  <h2>Notes and Writing Productivity Apps</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>For developers, MarkDown has become the most convenient way to organize as well as create documents. If you are not familiar with Markdown, I highly recommend taking 30 minutes and becoming familiar with it:</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Adam Pritchard’s Quick Reference</a></li><li><a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Github’s Mastering Markdown</a> </li><li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">John Gruber’s Markdown Guide</a></li></ul>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Whether it’s communications, documentation, blogging, or note taking, Markdown is a great way to keep your text organized and formatted. Therefore many note taking apps use Markdown, including the one I use - <a href="https://bear.app/?ref=okproductive">Bear</a>. To point out, Bear works only on iOS and Mac and a web front-end is in the works. However, Bear’s strong point is its simplicity, versatility as well as UI.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Conversely, if you prefer to use something besides Bear or any Markdown specific app, there’s always Google Docs. Most importantly, since Google Docs is so widely accepted, sharing documents has become easy and painless. For instance, I’ll explicitly use Google Docs for show notes and any long form writing which needs to be shared.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:html -->
  <iframe src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/584c906b" width="100%" height="180" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" seamless="true" style="width:100%; height:180px;"></iframe>
  <!-- /wp:html -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>For other long-form writing, I am a big fan of <a href="https://ulysses.app/?ref=empowerapps">Ulysses</a>.  Just as with Bear, <a href="https://ulysses.app/?ref=empowerapps">Ulysses</a> is specifically for macOS and iOS, however its purpose is explicitly long-form distraction-free writing. Most importantly, it has a great UI and has helped keep my writing organized and flow easily. Additionally, it can export to several formats such as Word Doc, HTML, PDF, Wordpress, Medium, and more. Besides my writing, I also record podcasts and do video as well.</p>

  <!-- /wp:image -->

  <!-- wp:heading -->
  <h2>Creative Apps</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>For doing any multimedia, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="including podcasting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://leogdion.name/2019/06/13/podcasting-getting-started-content-recording-audience/" target="_blank">including podcasting</a>, I recommend two suites: Adobe or Apple. First, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/?ref=empowerapps">Adobe’s Creative Cloud</a> is great if that is a focus of what you do. For instance, I’ve used Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier, and Audition and each have helped with artwork, video production, and podcast production. However if its steep price is too much for you, I’d recommend looking at what Apple provides for free with iMovie and GarageBand. Most importantly, both offer plenty for beginners as well as intermediates before you move to Apple’s Logic or Final Cut Pro.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Similarly, for recording video I use <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS</a> as well as <a href="https://www.filmicpro.com/?ref=empowerapps">FiLMiC Pro</a>. OBS is great for live streaming demos or tutorials as well as on-screen recording. Conversely, OBS has a learning curve but there’s a lot you can do as a beginner. On the other hand for recording my presentations or video of myself, I use FiLMiC Pro on my iPhone. For one thing as advanced as iPhones are, you can do videos at 4K resolution and 60 Frames Per Second. In addition, I also use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filmic-remote/id661488661?ref=empowerapps">FiLMiC Remote</a> on a second iPhone to preview and control the recording as it is being done.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Afterwards once I’ve edited the video or audio recording, I’ll need to share it with my audience.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <h2>Marketing Apps</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Social media can be quite overwhelming, which is why I have a set of productivity apps to keep me active as opposed to distracted. For instance, <a href="https://buffer.com/?ref=empowerapps">Buffer</a> is a great way to make sure your social media queue is active without constantly being reminded by what’s out there. Furthermore, Buffer can connect with several social media accounts as well as allow you to schedule posts with existing media. Besides social media, email is still actively used by many folks. Therefore, <a href="https://mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a> is a great service for starting your own email list. For instance, whenever I need to update folks on products, services, content; Mailchimp allows for me to automate and schedule email out to my various audiences. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <p>Besides email I use <a href="https://slack.com/?ref=empowerapps">Slack</a> pretty frequently. Slack is a great way to communicate with a team, find a community, or share documents. Notably, there is practically a Slack community for all sorts of developer languages, frameworks, and tools. In addition, Slack also uses Markdown for text formatting, has great shortcuts to channels and folks, and a decent bot and developer ecosystem for customization. </p>

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>When a Slack message or email won’t do, I typically setup video meetings with <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. Most importantly, what Zoom brings to video conferencing is simplicity and the ability to just work. Besides its app (which is offered on multiple platforms), Zoom requires nothing else. After finding the right time for the meeting, I’ll schedule a time and send a link to the meeting using Zoom. Zoom also allows for recording of video calls for later reference.</p>

  <h2>Avoid Over Optimizing Productivity Apps</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Finding the best productivity apps can be great but avoid being sucked in by it’s endless list of features. Have it do the job you want and be done with it. One of the biggest time sucks is over optimization of apps as well. Don’t spend too much time finding the right app or learning every shortcut and feature it offers. </p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a new year here, it’s a good time to talk about goals and how to reach them.</p>
          <p>Let’s take a few results you may want in 2018:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Lose Weight</li>
          <li>Publish A Book</li>
          <li>Learn To Play the Piano</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are a few problems with these <em>goals</em>. For one thing all three of these <em>goals</em> are some combination of ambiguous, complex, abstract or out of your control. What these really are are the <em>results</em> you want by the end of the year. Today I want to break down these <em>results</em> into actual committed actions.<!--more--></p>

          <!-- wp:image {"id":18,"align":"center"} -->
          <figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"><img src="https://leogdion.name/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/diagram-for-goals-e1535132251116.png" alt="" class="wp-image-18"/></figure>
          <!-- /wp:image -->

          <h2>Making Results Actionable</h2>
          <p>First thing you need to do is break these down into actual actions. Ask yourself what actions you need to do to achieve those results:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Lose Weight
          <ul>
          <li>Exercise</li>
          <li>Diet</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Publish Book
          <ul>
          <li>Write</li>
          <li>Research Publishing</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Learn to Play the Piano
          <ul>
          <li>Take a class</li>
          <li>Practice</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>These are things you can actual <strong>do</strong>. Losing Weight for instance is a complex problem requirement many habits and lifestyle changes.<br>Now that you have actual actions, you <strong>need</strong> to allocate time to commit to these.</p>
          <h2>Scheduling Actions</h2>
          <p>There are two reasons to schedule your actions this:</p>
          <ol>
          <li>You make sure nothing short of an emergency will prevent you from doing those things.</li>
          <li>You can see whether those actions are in fact achievable.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This helps you understand what you can actually do and it forces you to budget your time accordingly. So actions now become part your schedule:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Exercise becomes <strong>Exercise between 6am - 8am every Monday, Wednesday, Friday</strong></li>
          <li>Write becomes <strong>Write between 9am - 11am every Thursday</strong></li>
          <li>Practice becomes <strong>Practice Playing the Piano every Monday and Thursday from 8pm - 9pm</strong></li>
          <li>Research Publishing becomes <strong>Research Publishing next Tuesday from 2pm-4pm</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are of course weeks where the schedule may not work out perfectly but you can always move a specific appointment to a different time. The important thing to make sure you are committing to that amount of time either total over the whole period or per week if something which is recurring (exercise, writing, etc...).</p>
          <h2>Dealing with Ambiguous Actions</h2>
          <p>If an action has an indeterminate amount time; It may still be too ambiguous, complex, abstract or unachievable. There are several ways to fix this:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Break the action down even further into sub-actions or steps.
          <ul>
          <li>Research Publishing
          <ul>
          <li>List Publishing Platforms</li>
          <li>Compare Platforms on List</li>
          <li>Make Decision Based on Comparison</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Be as specific as possible for those actions:
          <ul>
          <li>Research Publishing
          <ul>
          <li>List 7 Online Publishing Platforms</li>
          <li>Compare Platforms on List based on Price, Formats, and Compatibility</li>
          <li>Sign up for the Publishing Platform Based on Comparison</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Schedule a specific time to complete the task
          <ul>
          <li>Research Publishing
          <ul>
          <li>List 5-7 Online Publishing Platforms on Monday from 3pm - 5pm</li>
          <li>Compare Platforms on List based on Price, Formats, and Compatibility from 8am - Noon on Thursday</li>
          <li>Sign up for the Publishing Platform Based on Comparison from 8am - Noon on Next Tuesday</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If the task isn’t completed, you have the choice the decide to allocate more time after or quit and realize your goal may not be achievable. The quicker you quit one goal - the more you have time to achieve another. Don’t fall for the Sunk Cost Fallacy.</p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>For 2018, you have the ability to make things actually happen. Follow these simple rules:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Break down your goals into more as specific an action as possible</li>
          <li>Use your calendar to schedule time for specific actions</li>
          <li>If you don’t know how much time to allocate repeat process of breaking down action into more specific sub-actiosn</li>
          <li>If you still can’t allocate time, cap the action to a specific time.</li>
          <li>If you can’t complete the action in that time, make a decision to quit and allocate time further.</li>
          </ul>]]></content:encoded>
