[On October
11,](https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/speaking-a2-speculid-tryswiftnyc/)
I spoke at [Ann Arbor
Cocoaheads](https://www.meetup.com/A2-CocoaHeads/events/254589885/) at
ArborMoon and gave some swift development tips. Specifically based my
experience developing
[Speculid](https://speculid.com/?utm_source=learning-swift&utm_medium=post)
for macOS as well as [Try!Swift New
York.](https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/swift-thoughts-tryswift-nyc-2018/)

> Leo will share some thoughts on the challenges in building Speculid,
> such as using C++ libraries in a Swift app, continuous integration
> (Travis-Ci) and more. He'll also be freshly back from TrySwift in NYC
> and will share some of his observations on the Swift community.
