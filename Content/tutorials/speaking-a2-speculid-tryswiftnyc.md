# Speaking at A2 Cocoaheads on Speculid and Try!Swift


Next Thursday on October 11, I'll be speaking at the Ann Arbor Cocoaheads at ArborMoon on developing Speculid for macOS as well as my thoughts from Try!Swift New York.


> Leo will share some thoughts on the challenges in building Speculid, such as using C++ libraries in a Swift app, continuous integration (Travis-Ci) and more. He'll also be freshly back from TrySwift in NYC and will share some of his observations on the Swift community.


Be sure to RSVP for the event if you can make it. I look forward to seeing you there.
