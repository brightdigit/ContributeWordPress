[Next Thursday on October
11,](https://www.meetup.com/A2-CocoaHeads/events/254589885/) I\'ll be
speaking at the Ann Arbor Cocoaheads at ArborMoon on developing
[Speculid](https://speculid.com/?utm_source=learning-swift&utm_medium=post)
for macOS as well as my thoughts from [Try!Swift New
York.](https://www.tryswift.co/events/2018/nyc/)

> Leo will share some thoughts on the challenges in building Speculid,
> such as using C++ libraries in a Swift app, continuous integration
> (Travis-Ci) and more. He\'ll also be freshly back from TrySwift in NYC
> and will share some of his observations on the Swift community.
