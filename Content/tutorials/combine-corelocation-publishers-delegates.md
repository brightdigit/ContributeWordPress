Most of the APIs from Apple come from an era of Objective-C and the
Delegation Pattern. With this in mind, the challenge is figuring how to
adapt for SwiftUI. Specifically we want to create Publishers from
delegates using Combine.

For instance, [my app Heartwitch is an Apple Watch app for live
streamers](https://heartwitch.app). In this case, It uses HealthKit
which implants the delegation pattern frequently. Additionally, I am
using newer technologies such as Vapor 4, Independent Watch Apps, and
most importantly SwiftUI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently covered [this topic at 360iDev
2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkFxOlmLWoA), so in this series of
articles, I'd like to go into detail regarding the process. That is the
process of adapting an older API for Combine. Specifically **we are
going to be building a basic SwiftUI app which displays your latitude
and longitude with CoreLocation.** This includes:

For this part, we\'ll be getting into how to create a `Protocol` and
`Class` which will act as a go-between for the *Delegation Pattern* and
the *Reactive Functional Programming* of **SwiftUI** and **Combine**.

## Gonna Delegate Like It's 2009

For over a decade, Apple frequently used the Delegation Pattern for
giving developers the ability to respond, update, and act in place of a
UI object. This pattern has a plethora of benefits especially in
Objective-C. However, with Swift and especially SwiftUI, this pattern
becomes awkward.

This is where it becomes necessary to make a delegate respond in such a
way that SwiftUI can handle updates.

With Apple's older APIs, we typically see this:

``` {.wp-block-code}
protocol NSDelegate : NSObjectProtocol {
  func manager(_ manager: NSManager, doneWith data: AnyObject)
  func manager(_ manager: NSManager, grantedPermission: Bool)
}
class NSManager : NSObject {
  weak var delegate : NSDelegate?
  
  func requestAuthorization() {}
  func doThing () {}
}
```

In the case of **CoreLocation** we see this:

``` {.wp-block-code}
protocol CLLocationManagerDelegate : NSObjectProtocol {
  func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation])
  func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didChangeAuthorization status: CLAuthorizationStatus)
}
class CLLocationManager : NSObject {
  weak var delegate : CLLocationManagerDelegate?
  
  func requestWhenInUseAuthorization() {}
  func startUpdatingLocation () {}
}
```

In other words, we'll need to create Combine *Publishers* which our
`ObservableObject` can listen or react to. Once the `ObservableObject`
reacts properly, then the `View` will update accordingly. In the end, we
should see this in our application:

Before we setup our publishers, let\'s scaffold our `View` and
`ObservableObject`.

## SwiftUI Scaffolding

Let\'s first start by building our SwiftUI View. In this case, we\'ll be
creating a SwiftUI view along with an `ObservableObject`.

``` {.wp-block-code}
struct LocationView: View {
  // CLLocationManager is basically a singleton so an EnvironmentObject ObservableObject makes sense
  @EnvironmentObject var locationObject: CoreLocationObject
  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      // use our extension method to display a description of the status
      Text("\(locationObject.authorizationStatus.description)")
        .onTapGesture {
          self.locationObject.authorize()
        }
      // use Optional.map to hide the Text if there's no location
      self.locationObject.location.map {
        Text($0.description)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This `LocationView` will simply display one line with a description of
the location with a line describing the `CLAuthorizationStatus` using
this extension:

``` {.wp-block-code}
extension CLAuthorizationStatus: CustomStringConvertible {
  public var description: String {
    switch self {
    case .authorizedAlways:
      return "Always Authorized"
    case .authorizedWhenInUse:
      return "Authorized When In Use"
    case .denied:
      return "Denied"
    case .notDetermined:
      return "Not Determined"
    case .restricted:
      return "Restricted"
    @unknown default:
      return "🤷‍♂️"
    }
  }
}
```

Now let\'s go ahead and define our `ObservableObject`, named
`CoreLocationObject`:

``` {.wp-block-code}
import Combine
import CoreLocation
import SwiftUI
class CoreLocationObject: ObservableObject {
  @Published var authorizationStatus = CLAuthorizationStatus.notDetermined
  @Published var location: CLLocation?
  init() { }
}
```

Lastly, make sure that you set the `EnvironmentObject` in your
application using:

``` {.wp-block-code}
LocationView().environmentObject(CoreLocationObject())
```

Now, we have our scaffolding setup, let\'s plug-in *CoreLocation*.

## Extending Delegates into Combine Publishers

![](https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Combine-ing-the-Old-with-the-New-360iDev-August-2020.001-2-1024x538.png){.wp-image-1040}

With the Delegation Pattern, the Delegate (in this case
`CoreLocationManagerDelegate`) will receive location updates. Therefore
it is the ideal object to create publishers for our `ObservableObject`.

In order for our `ObservableObject` to react to *CoreLocation* changes,
the delegate will have to create *Publishers* for us. With this in mind,
I have extended to delegate to be a ***Publicist***. That is to say the
*Delegate* will also be a *Publisher Factory*.

``` {.wp-block-code}
protocol CLLocationManagerCombineDelegate: CLLocationManagerDelegate {
  func authorizationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never>
  func locationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<[CLLocation], Never>
}
```

In the case of our application, we are displaying the authorization
status of *Core Location* as well as the latitude and longitude.
Therefore, we only need two methods implemented for our publishers.

Here is the implementation of our new protocol:

``` {.wp-block-code}
class CLLocationManagerPublicist: NSObject, CLLocationManagerCombineDelegate {
  let authorizationSubject = PassthroughSubject<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never>()
  let locationSubject = PassthroughSubject<[CLLocation], Never>()
  func authorizationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never> {
    return Just(CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus())
      .merge(with:
        authorizationSubject.compactMap { $0 }
      ).eraseToAnyPublisher()
  }
  func locationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<[CLLocation], Never> {
    return locationSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
  }
  func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
    locationSubject.send(locations)
  }
  func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didFailWithError _: Error) {
    // Implement to avoid crashes
    // Extra Credit: Create a publisher for errors :/
  }
  func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didChangeAuthorization status: CLAuthorizationStatus) {
    authorizationSubject.send(status)
  }
}
```

Let's breakdown how this class works.

## The Power of Type Erasing Publishers

**Our Publicist doesn't need to hold onto any values. In the end, it
solely serves the purpose of transforming data from the
`CoreLocationManager` to the `ObservableObject`.** For this reason,
we'll be using a `PassthroughSubject` for the `CLLocation` and
`CLAuthorizationStatus`. That is to say, `PassthroughSubject` doesn\'t
hold any values as they receive values but passes them on.

With the `PassthroughSubject` properties in place, our delegate can send
the values received from the delegate methods to the subjects.

Creating our first *publisher* for `CLLocation` is fairly simple:

``` {.wp-block-code}
class CLLocationManagerPublicist: NSObject, CLLocationManagerCombineDelegate {
...
  let locationSubject = PassthroughSubject<[CLLocation], Never>()
  func locationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<[CLLocation], Never> {
    return locationSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
  }
  func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
    locationSubject.send(locations)
  }
...
}
```

What's important to realize is that we need to implement type erasure
using `eraseToAnyPublisher`. The introduction of SwiftUI and Combine
included improvements to Swift. These improvement allow for powerful
transformations which can result in fairly complex Generic Types. For
instance our `authorizationPublisher` has a return type `AnyPublisher`:

``` {.wp-block-code}
  func authorizationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never> {
    return Just(CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus())
      .merge(with:
        authorizationSubject.compactMap { $0 }
      ).eraseToAnyPublisher()
  }
```

Without `eraseToAnyPublisher`, the return type would be:

``` {.wp-block-code}
Publishers.Merge<Just<CLAuthorizationStatus>, Publishers.CompactMap<PassthroughSubject<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never>, CLAuthorizationStatus>>
```

Likewise with the `locationPublisher`, the return type would be:

``` {.wp-block-code}
PassthroughSubject<[CLLocation], Never>
```

In the end, this makes creating Protocols and Return Types fairly
complex. **As far as the `ObservableObject` is concerned, it doesn't
care how the publisher is transformed but the result types returned.**

Therefore our Protocol only needs a `AnyPublisher` return type. In the
end, we can both simplify and hide the method of functional
transformation using `eraseToAnyPublisher`. Likewise, the implementation
calls `eraseToAnyPublisher` to reduce the return type and match the
Protocol\'s method signature.

Now that we have figured out how to creating matching Publisher types,
let's transform `CLAuthorizationStatu`s so it is usable within the view.

## Transforming Authorization Status into a Publisher

While our `locationSubject` reflects the values from *CoreLocation*, the
`authorizationSubject` will be out of sync from the reality of
*CoreLocation*'s status. For this reason, we'll need to write some code
include the initial status along with whatever the `PassthroughSubject`
receives.

``` {.wp-block-code}
  func authorizationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never> {
    return Just(CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus())
      .merge(with:
        authorizationSubject
      ).eraseToAnyPublisher()
  }
```

While `CoreLocationManagerDelegate` sends updates to
`authorizationStatus`, we need to have access to the initial status via
`CLLocationManager.authorizedStatus`. Luckily, Combine includes a
built-in *Publisher* for single values using `Just`.

`Just` gives us the initial value published however we need to include
the remaining published values from our `PassthroughSubject`. For this
reason, we can use `merge` to join the intial value with the result from
the our `authorizationSubject`:

We have the publisher factories setup now!

## What\'s Next?

In our next part in this series, we\'ll learn how to use this
implementation in our `ObservableObject` `CoreLocationObject`.
**Specifically, we\'ll be getting into power of function programming
