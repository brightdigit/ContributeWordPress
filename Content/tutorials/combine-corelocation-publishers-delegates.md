Most of the APIs from Apple come from an era of Objective-C and the
Delegation Pattern. With this in mind, the challenge is figuring how to
adapt for SwiftUI. Specifically we want to create Publishers from
delegates using Combine.

For instance, [my app Heartwitch is an Apple Watch app for live
streamers](https://heartwitch.app). In this case, It uses HealthKit
which implants the delegation pattern frequently. Additionally, I am
using newer technologies such as Vapor 4, Independent Watch Apps, and
most importantly SwiftUI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently covered [this topic at 360iDev
2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkFxOlmLWoA), so in this series of
articles, I’d like to go into detail regarding the process. That is the
process of adapting an older API for Combine. Specifically **we are
going to be building a basic SwiftUI app which displays your latitude
and longitude with CoreLocation.** This includes:

-   Creating Publishers from Delegates
-   [Using Function Reactive Programming to Transform Values
    (Part 2)](https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/combine-corelocation-receiving-handling-events/)
-   [Understanding FlatMap and Built-In Publishers
    (Part 3)](https://learningswift.brightdigit.com/combine-corelocation-swiftui-delegates/)

For this part, we'll be getting into how to create a `Protocol` and
`Class` which will act as a go-between for the *Delegation Pattern* and
the *Reactive Functional Programming* of **SwiftUI** and **Combine**.

## Gonna Delegate Like It’s 2009

For over a decade, Apple frequently used the Delegation Pattern for
giving developers the ability to respond, update, and act in place of a
UI object. This pattern has a plethora of benefits especially in
Objective-C. However, with Swift and especially SwiftUI, this pattern
becomes awkward.

This is where it becomes necessary to make a delegate respond in such a
way that SwiftUI can handle updates.

With Apple’s older APIs, we typically see this:

    protocol NSDelegate : NSObjectProtocol {
      func manager(_ manager: NSManager, doneWith data: AnyObject)
      func manager(_ manager: NSManager, grantedPermission: Bool)
    }
    class NSManager : NSObject {
      weak var delegate : NSDelegate?
      
      func requestAuthorization() {}
      func doThing () {}
    }

In the case of **CoreLocation** we see this:

    protocol CLLocationManagerDelegate : NSObjectProtocol {
      func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation])
      func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didChangeAuthorization status: CLAuthorizationStatus)
    }
    class CLLocationManager : NSObject {
      weak var delegate : CLLocationManagerDelegate?
      
      func requestWhenInUseAuthorization() {}
      func startUpdatingLocation () {}
    }

In other words, we’ll need to create Combine *Publishers* which our
`ObservableObject` can listen or react to. Once the `ObservableObject`
reacts properly, then the `View` will update accordingly. In the end, we
should see this in our application:

</figure>

Before we setup our publishers, let's scaffold our `View` and
`ObservableObject`.

## SwiftUI Scaffolding

Let's first start by building our SwiftUI View. In this case, we'll be
creating a SwiftUI view along with an `ObservableObject`.

    struct LocationView: View {
      // CLLocationManager is basically a singleton so an EnvironmentObject ObservableObject makes sense
      @EnvironmentObject var locationObject: CoreLocationObject
      var body: some View {
        VStack {
          // use our extension method to display a description of the status
          Text("\(locationObject.authorizationStatus.description)")
            .onTapGesture {
              self.locationObject.authorize()
            }
          // use Optional.map to hide the Text if there's no location
          self.locationObject.location.map {
            Text($0.description)
          }
        }
      }
    }

This `LocationView` will simply display one line with a description of
the location with a line describing the `CLAuthorizationStatus` using
this extension:

    extension CLAuthorizationStatus: CustomStringConvertible {
      public var description: String {
        switch self {
        case .authorizedAlways:
          return "Always Authorized"
        case .authorizedWhenInUse:
          return "Authorized When In Use"
        case .denied:
          return "Denied"
        case .notDetermined:
          return "Not Determined"
        case .restricted:
          return "Restricted"
        @unknown default:
          return "🤷‍♂️"
        }
      }
    }

Now let's go ahead and define our `ObservableObject`, named
`CoreLocationObject`:

    import Combine
    import CoreLocation
    import SwiftUI
    class CoreLocationObject: ObservableObject {
      @Published var authorizationStatus = CLAuthorizationStatus.notDetermined
      @Published var location: CLLocation?
      init() { }
    }

Lastly, make sure that you set the `EnvironmentObject` in your
application using:

    LocationView().environmentObject(CoreLocationObject())

Now, we have our scaffolding setup, let's plug-in *CoreLocation*.

## Extending Delegates into Combine Publishers

</figure>

With the Delegation Pattern, the Delegate (in this case
`CoreLocationManagerDelegate`) will receive location updates. Therefore
it is the ideal object to create publishers for our `ObservableObject`.

In order for our `ObservableObject` to react to *CoreLocation* changes,
the delegate will have to create *Publishers* for us. With this in mind,
I have extended to delegate to be a ***Publicist***. That is to say the
*Delegate* will also be a *Publisher Factory*.

    protocol CLLocationManagerCombineDelegate: CLLocationManagerDelegate {
      func authorizationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never>
      func locationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<[CLLocation], Never>
    }

In the case of our application, we are displaying the authorization
status of *Core Location* as well as the latitude and longitude.
Therefore, we only need two methods implemented for our publishers.

Here is the implementation of our new protocol:

    class CLLocationManagerPublicist: NSObject, CLLocationManagerCombineDelegate {
      let authorizationSubject = PassthroughSubject<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never>()
      let locationSubject = PassthroughSubject<[CLLocation], Never>()
      func authorizationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never> {
        return Just(CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus())
          .merge(with:
            authorizationSubject.compactMap { $0 }
          ).eraseToAnyPublisher()
      }
      func locationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<[CLLocation], Never> {
        return locationSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
      }
      func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
        locationSubject.send(locations)
      }
      func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didFailWithError _: Error) {
        // Implement to avoid crashes
        // Extra Credit: Create a publisher for errors :/
      }
      func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didChangeAuthorization status: CLAuthorizationStatus) {
        authorizationSubject.send(status)
      }
    }

Let’s breakdown how this class works.

## The Power of Type Erasing Publishers

**Our Publicist doesn’t need to hold onto any values. In the end, it
solely serves the purpose of transforming data from the
`CoreLocationManager` to the `ObservableObject`.** For this reason,
we’ll be using a `PassthroughSubject` for the `CLLocation` and
`CLAuthorizationStatus`. That is to say, `PassthroughSubject` doesn't
hold any values as they receive values but passes them on.

With the `PassthroughSubject` properties in place, our delegate can send
the values received from the delegate methods to the subjects.

Creating our first *publisher* for `CLLocation` is fairly simple:

    class CLLocationManagerPublicist: NSObject, CLLocationManagerCombineDelegate {
    ...
      let locationSubject = PassthroughSubject<[CLLocation], Never>()
      func locationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<[CLLocation], Never> {
        return locationSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
      }
      func locationManager(_: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
        locationSubject.send(locations)
      }
    ...
    }

What’s important to realize is that we need to implement type erasure
using `eraseToAnyPublisher`. The introduction of SwiftUI and Combine
included improvements to Swift. These improvement allow for powerful
transformations which can result in fairly complex Generic Types. For
instance our `authorizationPublisher` has a return type `AnyPublisher`:

      func authorizationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never> {
        return Just(CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus())
          .merge(with:
            authorizationSubject.compactMap { $0 }
          ).eraseToAnyPublisher()
      }

Without `eraseToAnyPublisher`, the return type would be:

    Publishers.Merge<Just<CLAuthorizationStatus>, Publishers.CompactMap<PassthroughSubject<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never>, CLAuthorizationStatus>>

Likewise with the `locationPublisher`, the return type would be:

    PassthroughSubject<[CLLocation], Never>

In the end, this makes creating Protocols and Return Types fairly
complex. **As far as the `ObservableObject` is concerned, it doesn’t
care how the publisher is transformed but the result types returned.**

Therefore our Protocol only needs a `AnyPublisher` return type. In the
end, we can both simplify and hide the method of functional
transformation using `eraseToAnyPublisher`. Likewise, the implementation
calls `eraseToAnyPublisher` to reduce the return type and match the
Protocol's method signature.

Now that we have figured out how to creating matching Publisher types,
let’s transform `CLAuthorizationStatu`s so it is usable within the view.

## Transforming Authorization Status into a Publisher

While our `locationSubject` reflects the values from *CoreLocation*, the
`authorizationSubject` will be out of sync from the reality of
*CoreLocation*’s status. For this reason, we’ll need to write some code
include the initial status along with whatever the `PassthroughSubject`
receives.

      func authorizationPublisher() -> AnyPublisher<CLAuthorizationStatus, Never> {
        return Just(CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus())
          .merge(with:
            authorizationSubject
          ).eraseToAnyPublisher()
      }

While `CoreLocationManagerDelegate` sends updates to
`authorizationStatus`, we need to have access to the initial status via
`CLLocationManager.authorizedStatus`. Luckily, Combine includes a
built-in *Publisher* for single values using `Just`.

`Just` gives us the initial value published however we need to include
the remaining published values from our `PassthroughSubject`. For this
reason, we can use `merge` to join the intial value with the result from
the our `authorizationSubject`:

We have the publisher factories setup now!

## What's Next?

In our next part in this series, we'll learn how to use this
implementation in our `ObservableObject` `CoreLocationObject`.
**Specifically, we'll be getting into power of function programming
within Reactive Functional Programming.** Enjoy!
