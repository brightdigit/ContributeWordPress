# Get Started Developing Server Side Swift with Vapor


Last month I spoke at SwiftTO in Toronto, a great conference with some great speakers. If you get a chance, check out all the talks here. My topic of choice was Vapor and how to get started. 



Here is the talk description:


> While Swift has been on Apple devices such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, and Apple TV, in the last few years it has started to reach the Linux Operating System. This has allowed Swift to move from client devices to servers. Now we have several server side frameworks such as Perfect, Kitura, and Vapor. In this talk, Leo Dion goes into the details of developing with Vapor on the Mac to deploying onto the server. We talk about managing multiple process in Swift-NIO, the Fluent ORM, serialization of data, and the setting up of routes and authentication. If you are interested in taking a deep dive into Vapor, youâ€™ll want to check out this talk.
