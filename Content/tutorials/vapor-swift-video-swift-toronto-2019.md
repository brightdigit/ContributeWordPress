Last month I spoke at [SwiftTO in Toronto](https://www.swiftconf.to/), a
great conference with some great speakers. If you get a chance, check
out [all the talks here.](https://vimeo.com/swiftto) My topic of choice
was Vapor and how to get started.

Here is the talk description:

> While Swift has been on Apple devices such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple
> Watch, Mac, and Apple TV, in the last few years it has started to
> reach the Linux Operating System. This has allowed Swift to move from
> client devices to servers. Now we have several server side frameworks
> such as Perfect, Kitura, and Vapor. In this talk, Leo Dion goes into
> the details of developing with Vapor on the Mac to deploying onto the
> server. We talk about managing multiple process in Swift-NIO, the
> Fluent ORM, serialization of data, and the setting up of routes and
> authentication. If you are interested in taking a deep dive into
> Vapor, you'll want to check out this talk.
