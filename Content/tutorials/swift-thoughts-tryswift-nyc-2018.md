I have to say I had a great time at [try!Swift New
York](https://www.tryswift.co/events/2018/nyc/) this year. I have been
to many developer conferences over the years but lately I have been
attending mostly business and startup conferences (i.e.
[MicroConf](https://www.microconf.com) and [Release
Notes](https://releasenotes.tv)).

Additionally, this is the first Apple developer conference I have ever
attended as opposed
toÂ [hosting](https://www.meetup.com/Lansing-CocoaHeads/), attending, and
[speaking](https://www.meetup.com/A2-CocoaHeads/events/246212307/) at a
Cocoaheads groups. This was a new environment.

I wanted to get a feel of where the winds are blowing in Swift and there
were some interesting trends to the topics presented:

## ARKit and CoreML

Big surprise right! ðŸ™ƒ

Apple has been showcasing and backing these technologies for a while.
Except for my occasional attempts at creating models, I haven't been
doing enough in this area and these talks reinforce my need to do
so.Â [Aileen Nielsen](https://twitter.com/tryswiftnyc) really broke down
how Machine Learning works. [Berta
Devant](https://twitter.com/bertadevant) explained how ARKit does face
tracking and can be used.Â [Audrey
Tam](https://twitter.com/mataharimau)Â explained how to build your own
model using Apple's new tools. [Kentaro
Matsumae](https://twitter.com/kenmaz)Â showed a great application using
his *Super Resolution* technique. Overall the need to invest time in
Machine Learning technology will continue to grow.

## Swift on the Server

Swift on the server is real and there is real corporate backing to it. I
happen to attend the workshop by IBM on [Kitura](https://www.kitura.io)
and got a glimpse of how to develop and deploy with Docker and
Kubernetes.Â [Gopal Sharma](https://twitter.com/gopalkri)Â spoke about the
challenges he's faced with Swift on the server.Â [Johannes
Weiss](https://twitter.com/johannesweiss)Â spoke about
[SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) which is the future of
client and server side communication.Â [Chris
Bailey](https://twitter.com/Chris__Bailey)Â &Â [Ian
Partridge](https://twitter.com/alfa)Â went into detail of Kitura's
deployment process and its future and [Logan
Wright](https://twitter.com/logmaestro) spoke about
[Vapor](https://vapor.codes).

If companies continue to adopt Vapor and Kitura, we'll continue to see
growth in that space. It's something Swift developers should seriously
spend some time understanding.

## Podcasting

Podcasts continue to be a growing area. I am the host of two
podcasts:Â [OkProductive](https://okproductive.com) and
[EmpowerApps.Show](https://www.empowerapps.show). I have followed
podcast networks like [Relay Fm](https://www.relay.fm) and
[Gimlet](https://www.gimletmedia.com), as well as software creators like
[Marco Arment](https://transistor.fm) and [Justin
Jackson](https://transistor.fm). So it was really interesting to
seeÂ [Leah Culver](https://twitter.com/leahculver)Â from Breaker talk
about their story and what she's learned about growing a software
company. It'll be interesting to see what other startups flourish in
this new industry.

## Other Topics...

Other Swift topics which were of interest to me included:

-   [Christina Moulton](https://twitter.com/ChristinaMltn)Â talking about
    **Siri Shortcuts**
-   [Tom Harrington](https://twitter.com/atomicbird)Â on [Core Data in
    Swift](https://halide.cam)
-   [Felix Krause](https://twitter.com/KrauseFx)Â from
    [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) on trusting 3rd-party SDKs
-   [Peter Steinberger](https://twitter.com/steipete)Â on hacking
    Marzipan (i.e. using UIKit to build Mac Apps)
-   [Kaya Thomas](https://twitter.com/kthomas901)Â on building advanced
    notifications
-   [Sebastiaan de With](https://twitter.com/sdw)Â on building delightful
    user interfaces at Apple and now with [Halide](https://halide.cam)

## Conclusion

try!Swift was a great conference and a great opportunity to meet a lot
of great people in the Swift space. If you are in the Swift space,
especially a beginner, I would definitely recommend checking it out.
