# macOS Development for iOS Developers


There has been a recent rumor about Apple allowing developers to create multi-platform apps for macOS and iOS. The hope is that iOS developers will be able to bring their apps over to macOS. Of course this can already be done. The question is whether you should migrate your iOS app over, how you can do it, what the future may be for multi-platform iOS macOS apps.





## Why Should You Get Into Mac Development


There are some very good reasons to get into Mac development if you already are an iOS developer.

## Remedies For Porting to macOS

-   Just Copy the Code
-   

     	more code to maintain
     	most flexible
     	least consistent



-   Use Lower-Level Common Framework
-   

     	less code to maintain
     	more difficult to provide functionality
     	some consistency



-   Use Adapter Pattern
-   

     	less code to maintain than copying
     	more consistency with some flexibility



-   Preprocessor Directives
-   

     	use for small pieces of code which have little difference (i.e. NSColor / UIColor, etc…)
