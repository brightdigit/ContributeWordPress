> Whether you love being in front of the camera or hate it, there's no
> getting around the fact that personal branding is a huge part of the
> success -- or stagnation -- of your business. Personal branding helps
> in building confidence while gaining trusts, authenticity, and
> credibility. Join Courtney as she talks about why you should get in
> front of the camera, how to juggle personal and business-branded
> accounts and what you can do today to get started.
