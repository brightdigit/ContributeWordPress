We are happy to have Courtney Larvadain from Glow Social Media come and speak on Building Your Personal Brand at WLNS. This will be Wednesday, February 13 at Noon. Here are some details:






> Whether you love being in front of the camera or hate it, there’s no getting around the fact that personal branding is a huge part of the success – or stagnation – of your business. Personal branding helps in building confidence while gaining trusts, authenticity, and credibility. Join Courtney as she talks about why you should get in front of the camera, how to juggle personal and business-branded accounts and what you can do today to get started.Building Your Personal Brand - Meetup.Com
