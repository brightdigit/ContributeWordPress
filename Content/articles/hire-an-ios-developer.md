When you want to hire an iOS developer to build an app for you, it can
be hard to know what they need to know if you’re not a developer
yourself. This is pretty significant, as choosing the *right* developer
could have huge consequences once the project starts.

This post is a guide for **anyone looking to hire an iOS developer** and
needs to know what kind of knowledge and experience you should be
looking for. In this guide, we’ll detail what kinds of questions you
should be asking prospective developers and how you can recognize if
they know what you need them to know to create the app you want. 



## A Couple Things about Software...

It would be surprising if you’re looking into having an app created and
have never heard a lot of the jargon that developers and software
professionals use, but there are a couple of things you should know,
otherwise, the rest of this article is going to be confusing:

### User Interface

I know, this one probably seems really obvious: **a user interface (UI)
is any point of interaction between the computer and the human user.**
Really, most people get that, but what it is surprising is how often
people get this confused with other terms related to it, which is why
this is here.

In particular, there are two other terms where some people get muddled:
*Graphical User Interface (GUI)* and *User Experience (UX)*. **A GUI is
a type of composite UI, essentially universal to apps, which has tactile
and visual components.**

On the other hand, *UX* is a concept that people get confused much more
often. While related, they are different concepts: **UI refers simply to
the point of interaction; UX on the other hand, refers how you to design
a product and how you want the user to feel when they use it, the plan
you have to get the user to interact with your app.**

### Software Framework

**A software framework can be best explained as a package of code and
functionality that you can use to build software applications**. We use
this package to add certain app functions as well as to push software
features much faster. Therefore you can focus on what you need for your
app, rather than how it technically works. 

For instance, a framework provided by Apple could help facilitate using
GPS on your phone or fitness information from your Apple Watch. On the
other hand, there are third-party libraries (libraries are pre-built
lines of code that are commonly included in frameworks) to help
developers track bugs and crashes in real-time or display common
onboarding tutorials used in iPhone apps.

It is a bit like building or repairing a car: if you need a new muffler,
rather than building one from scratch (which would take a lot of time
and money), you would likely hire a mechanic or find a manufacturer who
makes mufflers for cars. You can do this for everything from the wheels
to the vehicle’s sound system. Software development with frameworks is
very similar.

Apple uses two main software frameworks: **Cocoa (for macOS)** and
**[Cocoa Touch (for
iOS)](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/WhatIsCocoa/WhatIsCocoa.html)**,
which contain all the tools, features, and templates you need to build
an application that will run on an Apple-built operating system. 

## What kind of iOS developer do you need?

To know what kind of a developer you need, namely either a general
developer or someone with specialized knowledge and skills.

This goes back to [an earlier article I put out on how to put together
an accurate project budget for the app you want to
develop](https://brightdigit.com/blog/2019/08/19/project-budget-ios-app/).
If you haven’t already read it, I invite you to go [check it out
here](https://brightdigit.com/blog/2019/08/19/project-budget-ios-app/).

Considerations for your app might include how you want it to look (and
how much of a priority its appearance is for you), whether you need it
to use different kinds of media (like video or audio), and how many
requirements have very specific technical needs (such as an integrated
payment system using *Stripe* or a similar platform).

The main consideration usually comes down to whether you need generalist
or specialist developers. This is pretty straightforward: **A generalist
has the advantage of being able to adapt if you have a range of
different requirements for your app, depending on what the requirements
for your app are and how well they know the framework that you will need
for your app.**

On the other hand, there are some things in iOS development that are
either very specific or niche that you will need to find a specialist.
For instance, you have an app that needs to connect to Bluetooth
devices, you will need a developer that knows how to use a framework
like *[Core
Bluetooth](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth)*,
which allows you to use certain Bluetooth devices with your app.

If you’re not sure what functions you need for your app, and the
possible ways of developing them, I recommend having a senior developer
or consultant take a look at your project idea and have them map out a
list of frameworks, libraries and tools that could be potentially used
to develop your app, especially those that only a specialist would be
expected to know. This way, you should have a suitable list of things
that developers you want to hire should know or have experience using.



## Can they build a UI?

Once you feel comfortable that a prospective developer, an important
question you should be asking is if they build the User Interface that
you need for your app.

This can be complex, as there are lots of ways of building a UI, but a
good starting point is asking to see their portfolio and ask a few
questions:

-   Does it have examples of UIs they’ve created in the past?
-   Do you like the way they look?
-   So much about developing a UI is aesthetic: do you like the way it
    looks, the way it responds when you push button or open a menu?
-   An additional question that you can ask is: How they prefer to build
    their user interface?

Previously, Apple suggested the use of
*[UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit)* and
*[Storyboards](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/Devpedia-CocoaApp/Storyboard.html)*
as the preferred way to build a UI. With Storyboards, the developer
creates images that show a “story” of how a user will interact with the
app. Alternatively, some developers prefer to code their app through
*UIKit* due to the limitations of *Storyboards*. However, with the
introduction of *[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)*
this year, many developers have been moving away from *UIKit* and
*Storyboards*, flocking to this new way to develop a user interface.

</figure>

## Can they be critically self-reflective?

In the end, regardless of the method they choose, **these choices
reflect to how they build software and whether it will work with your
team**. In software, there are almost always lots of different ways of
doing something: How to make an app function or look a certain way. Each
way will also have pros and cons associated with it, and every developer
will likely have a slightly different view of *good* ways developing an
app.

A good developer should, first and foremost, be consistent in their
approach to developing software and how they go about solving problems,
and **it is not unreasonable to expect them to be able to communicate
the benefits and trade-offs of certain software practices and design
patterns** (i.e. solutions to recurring problems), and the limits of the
libraries and frameworks they use, including what Apple might recommend
for iOS and Apple developers.

## If they are front-end developers, do they at least know a little about the back-end?

Just in case you’re not already familar, **front-end** generally refers
to the development of what users will directly interact with: the look,
feel and design of your app. **Back-end** refers to the development of
how your app actually works, how the application, as well as its server
and databases,  operate, and how it might interact with other pieces of
software, as well as creating and implementing updates.

You will generally find that most iOS developers are specialized in
front-end development. However, a few do know a bit of both front and
back-end development (commonly called full-stack developers, a kind of
generalist). Likewise, it is usually a good sign if a front-end
developer knows a little bit about how to do back-end work. For instance
how the app interacts with the back-end *Application Programming
Interfaces* (APIs).

This is valuable, as a developer that has a rounded field of knowledge
is much more useful when bugs or problems arise, as they will have an
understanding how the UI work they may have done on the front-end
relates back to the data storage and software architecture of the
back-end, making it easier to identify problems and find solutions.

What you as the interviewer are looking for are developers that can show
they understand how back-end development is related to what you need
them to do. Do they know a little bit about business logic, software
architecture, and back-end design patterns? 

### Do they have experience with any specialties with hardware or APIs?

As a subset of the above, specifically for iOS, it is usually worth
asking what APIs and hardware they have worked with interfacing with
iPhones. The more well-known ones include:

-   **[WatchKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit)**
    for building Apple Watch App
-   **[Core Bluetooth](https://developer.apple.com/bluetooth/)** for
    communicating directly with Bluetooth Devices
-   **[AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation)** for
    dealing with camera hardware as well as video
-   **[CoreData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata)**
    for local database storage
-   **[CoreLocation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation)**
    for GPS and navigation services
-   **[CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning)** for
    Machine Learning

If you have a special need for your app, this can be very helpful. In
fact it only means you would have access to their specialist knowledge.
Markedly, it is a sign they have a mature level of knowledge of the
Apple software ecosystem.

## Summary of Questions

I know the above is a lot to take in. Therefore, here's a quick list of
questions of the above:

### Before you start hiring

-   What are the **functional requirements** of your app?
-   Do you know **what frameworks, libraries, and tools** might be
    needed to develop that functionality?
-   Are you looking for **generalist developers, specialists, or a mix**
    of both?

### During hiring

-   Can they build the kind of **User Interface** you will need for your
    app?
-   Do they employ **Storyboards** (if that is important or useful for
    developing your app)?
-   What **process or philosophy** do they follow in developing
    software?
    -   Are they aware of **the benefits and trade-offs** of their
        approach?
    -   Is there **evidence** that they have considered other ways of
        doing the same kind of work?
-   If they are primarily a front-end developer, do they have knowledge,
    of the **back-end development** that will be needed to develop the
    app?
    -   Do they have any **specialist knowledge** or experience working
        with certain kinds of software APIs or hardware? 

Finally, if you’re an iOS developer and are preparing to take an
interview, I recommend you pick up *[**Alex Bush’s book, The iOS
Interview Guide**](https://gumroad.com/a/630830195)*. It’s a great
reference for helping you give clear answers to common questions, and
articulate what you know in a way that is easy to understand

## If that seems like too much, we can help with that!

Finding and hiring the right iOS or Apple developer can obviously be
very complicated, and challenging if you yourself are not a developer.
It could be very costly if you make the wrong choice, costing you time
and money fixing the mistakes of the wrong kind of developer.

At BrightDigit, we work with our clients to make sure, before a single
line of code is written, you have a clear plan of the work required to
build your app, what kinds of tools, frameworks, and other resources
that will be needed, and can even help you with that early step of
putting together the list of things that your developers will need to
know if your app is going to work the way you need it to.  If you’re
ready to build an app for your business, **email us at
