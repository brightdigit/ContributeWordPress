## Why have a website?

**Having an updated, easy to navigate website makes a huge difference.**

**If the foundation isn't done correctly, everything else will slowly fall apart and have problems**

## Finding the Right Web Designer

-   If you see a site you like, find out who built it.
-   Ask other business owners for recommendations. Most business owners will be more than willing to help.
-   Talk to family and friends. They may use a great service or know someone who does.

## Getting a Web Site the Right Way

-   You can build your own website but you may not have the time to upkeep it yourself. 
-   Asking a friend or relative to do it for cheap could result in website that is unable to be maintained or could be a poor foundation for the future.
-   When looking for the right web designer, be sure to ask around among business owner especially those with high quality web sites.
-   Finally, keep the first version of your site simple. Then build content on top of it in the future.
