Apple held a Special Event in September this year to introduce the
iPhone 11, Apple Watch Series 5, and Apple Arcade.

The event told us a lot about the direction of Apple going into 2020,
especially for those of us who develop apps for their platforms and want
to know what will be the leading edge of innovations for their products.
This is also useful for any business or organization that owns an iOS
app or is planning to develop one.

Here are the top four things that I think we all have to look forward to
with Apple in 2020:

## A Slowdown in Innovation for iPhone

**2019 may well be the year we have reached peak iPhone.** The iPhone 11
series of phones are a clear demonstration of Apple’s expertise and
development of mobile phone hardware. However, **the 11 doesn’t really
have any major hardware innovations compared to the iPhone X, although
it is a big step up in performance from the iPhone 8**. A clear
indication of this was the emphasis on the camera technology above
everything else.

This is really good news for those of us who are invested in iOS
development. The iPhone has become a sophisticated and mature product.
**This means that now is a great time to be developing an iOS app. With
the maturity of the iPhone where it is, we can rely on it to be a
consistent, stable platform for the foreseeable future.** Likewise in
the future, if you have an app, or are developing an app, it will be
relatively easy to maintain your app and there is a low risk of
obsolescence if you want to add new features.

## Big Breakthroughs Coming for Apple Watch

While the iPhone is maturing, the Apple Watch is just starting to get
really good. The new Series 5 introduces noticeable improvements to its
power usage, display and storage which show that the watch can be a
viable platform. Most importantly, I was happy to see them introduce an
always-on display, which makes it a lot easier to use.

At the same time, I don’t think it’s *quite* become an amazing product
yet, but it’s going to be within the decade at the latest. With a little
more improvement to its battery and processor, it could become a great
hardware platform.

That said, **it means now is a great time to start thinking about
developing an app for the Apple Watch, especially for organizations in
the health and fitness sector**. I would venture this could be the
perfect platform to have a fitness app in the next year

## Potential Change to How We Buy and Use iOS Apps

Although not actually a new announcement, the promotion of Apple Arcade,
and its actual launch several days later, is worthy of attention. Apple
Arcade uses a subscription model for its video games and is accessible
across all Apple platforms. Subscriptions for apps (video games are,
after all, a kind of app) is something of a new tack for Apple and shows
they are invested in exploring this. I think it’s worth noting how great
this could be, especially as it has already attracted some big game
developers to get on board: Konami and Capcom. Also: good riddance to
micro-transactions!

**I hope this will show is the potential for using subscriptions for
apps, instead of outright purchases, and Apple expands this into other
areas, most especially with their Pro Apps**. This hopefully will
improve Apple’s app ecosystem, which is lackluster in a few areas –
notably with the new iPad. **The iPad and especially iPad Pro, though a
great piece of hardware, is sadly lacking in Pro apps.** Maybe Apple
will one day offer the Apple Arcade “bundle” approach for great iOS
productivity apps, something the company Setapp is already doing on the
Mac.

## SwiftUI Changing How We Develop User Interfaces

SwiftUI, Apple’s new user interface (UI) framework, is changing the way
we develop UIs for all Apple products by making it easier to quickly
develop a dynamic interface that is more flexible and better reflects
how people actually use apps. This is happening slowly, as it requires a
shift in the way many developers think about UI design, but it has more
potential than other, older frameworks, like UIKit. As well, SwiftUI
only supports the latest Apple operating systems (iOS 13, Catalina,
etc.) and doesn’t support certain kinds of widgets.

Without getting too technical, SwiftUI uses declarative programming,
rather than an imperative (which is what UIKit uses). Declarative
programming is similar to HTML, as it describes parameters of the UI of
a software application, rather than specifying how to draw it on the
screen. For example:

**Imperative**

    webpage.drawTitle(“Title”)
    webpage.drawParagraph(“Lorem Ipsum”) 

**Declarative**

    <title>Title</title>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>

The other aspect of SwiftUI that makes it promising is that it is
cross-platform compatible. This means you can now learn one programming
language (Swift) and one framework  
(SwiftUI), and you can create UIs for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
This is huge for developers, and will hopefully mean we can code for our
customers faster, with more consistent, higher-quality results.

It’s still a little early to know for sure what the full impact of
SwiftUI will be, but it definitely something to keep an eye on. Time
will tell.

## Want to Get Ahead of the Curve?

iOS app development is constantly changing and evolving, as you can see
from what I’ve outlined above. Knowing what is helpful, unhelpful, or
just important to recognize in the field often comes down to experience,
being aware of trends, and having a sense of Apple’s goals as a platform
and service provider.

At Bright Digit, we are specialists in building apps for iOS. We are
attuned to every announcement from Apple and how it could impact our
craft. We work with our clients to pass along this knowledge and
expertise to them, so they too can keep their apps ahead of the curve,
able to deliver the best experience possible to their customers.

If you are ready to deliver that same experience to your customers,
email <info@brightdigit.com>. We would like to hear about your app or
plans to make one!
