Of everything announced at Apple's September Event, the new Apple Watch
Series 4 took the biggest leap forward in Apple's product lineup. With a
truckload of new health functionality and bigger screens, is now the
time to bring a watch app to market?

## Health Features

While the new Apple watch announcement touted all sorts of
functionality, health features took a starring role. 

### Basic Electrocardiogram

First, this watch can now [take a basic electrocardiogram
(ECG)](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-watch-series-4/). While this in
no way replaces a full ECG workup in a hospital or doctor's office, it
should be a useful indicator that something could be up with your heart
and worth discussing with your doctor.

Apple immediately tempered any skepticism of the watch's ability to
perform a medical function by announcing…

### FDA and AHA Support

Both the Food and Drug Administration and the American Heart Association
gave the new watch a qualified endorsement. While it could take 5-10
years for a watch to be officially considered a medical device, both
organizations consider the health features that Apple is putting into
the watch a good thing.

### Siri! I've Fallen!

The new Apple watch added another health feature that alerts both wearer
and potentially emergency services when the wearer falls. If the
accelerometer in the watch registers a fall, it notifies the wearer. If
the wearer does not respond to the notification, Siri will call out to
emergency services.

It is not yet clear how the watch handles edge cases. For example, if
someone gets drunk and passes out, will Siri phone 911? Still, this
technology could increase the independence of seniors and other users
with mobility issues.

### Hardware Changes

While health functionality headlined the show, the Apple watch 4's new
hardware was nothing to sneeze at. An upgraded processor makes the watch
twice as fast as its predecessors (in terms of processing speed). Even
more striking is the increased screen size on the watch face.

Thankfully the new screen sizes will work with the previous generation
of watch bands. For example, the new 40mm screen will work with the
older 38mm watch bands. But with the increased screen size and reduced
bezel, that same new 40mm screen will have more usable screen space than
the old 42mm screen did.

## When Should I Make A Watch App?

With the renewed emphasis on health apps and the increased screen space,
does it make sense for your business to make a watch app?

First, anyone in health or fitness should consider adding a watch app to
their offering. Apple has both grown the market for smartwatches and
demonstrated that users are interested in health and fitness
tracking.   

Second, the new Apple watch is still a fantastic platform for any
feature that tracks time or time-based activities.

Third, though the iPhone isn't going anywhere, as a platform it's
stabilized. The Apple watch still has plenty of room for growth, and
that means more business opportunities.

Fourth, if you have already an iPhone app, it likely makes sense to add
watch notifications if you haven't already. The watch is not a device
that you can purchase and run solo; it needs an iPhone to unlock its
full capabilities.
