For those of us heavily invested in iOS development, it was unfortunate
to have to miss this year’s Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2020
(WWDC 2020) in person. It’s just as much a chance to connect directly
with iOS developers as it is to find out what Apple has in store for us.

Just the same, Apple announced, via virtual conference, a lot of things
we can feel excited about. Some things have the potential to really
shift the way we create software.

Here’s you need to know about what Apple revealed to us about what
they’ve been working on.

## iOS 14 gives us a lot more smart, a little bit less phone

Far and away, the most exciting announcements from Apple are coming in
with iOS 14. WWDC 2020 appears to be the year where having a big screen
has become a central issue for iPhone design. Likewise, **the iPhone is
less about making calls and more about having a small, smart device in
your pocket.** This is perhaps best demonstrated by phone calls no
longer taking up the whole screen when in use (Siri doesn’t either).

Here’s a few other things that are going to matter with iOS 14 that
we’ve found in the beta version:

## Some of the best ideas come from your competition

With this rethink about what the phone screen is for, Apple offers
things that will be familiar to Android users: widgets, app clips, and
default app selection.

### Widgets

This feature is one Android users have been able to enjoy for years, and
now it’s coming to Apple - especially for the iPhone. This makes sense
with the purpose of the iPhone being less about making calls. The iPhone
has become more of a source of information that you can easily place at.
These widgets will come in all kinds of sizes and, will look better than
anything we’ve ever had in older iOS versions. Additonally, the iPhone
will even be able to stack widgets on the app screen intellegently,
based on user behavior and settings. 

#### SwiftUI continues to improve at WWDC 2020

SwiftUI is now a year old. And at WWDC 2020 they announced new
improvements and additions for the new releases. You can build an entire
app now within SwiftUI, without needing to resort to any of the older
APIs. With the introduction of widgets and build complications, Apple
made WidgetKit available only via SwiftUI, their API for building
Widgets.

Apple has designed their widgets to be flexible and compatible across
all their devices. So the small widget is conveniently the same size as
the standard watchOS interface. While the large version of the same
widget could fit comfortably on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. It’s your
choice as a developer in which sizes you want to support. On top of
that, Apple enabled the use of “stacks” and “smart stacks”. These
"stacks" allow you to layer different widgets over each other and order
them according to user preference and behavior.

### App Clips

Another smart idea that is coming over from the Android world is App
Clips. App Clips are basically “previews” of full apps. They enable you
to quickly download and temporarily check out an app. For instance, you
want to try a new food delivery app. You may not want to compare it
against the one you already have. Additionally, you may only use the app
one instance and never need it again. You can use the App Clip to try it
out and decide if you want to keep it. This reduces cluttering up your
phone app screens and data storage.

### Default Apps

It boggles the mind that we’ve never been able to choose which app runs
by default when opening files or doing routine tasks on the iPhone
(something that Android and Mac users take for granted). Now we will on
iOS 14, and that can only be a good thing, for developers and consumers
alike.

## Apple Silicon: New chips for a new era for the Mac

After years of using Intel-built processors for the Mac, Apple is
transitioning to using their own Apple Silicon CPUs. This is a
monumental shift for Apple. They’ve already demonstrated that these
64-bit ARM-based chips can easily match the speed of comparative Intel
chips while drawing less power on other devices.

What we can expect in the next 10-15 years are Macs that have better
performance per watt and high-performance GPUs. This is all great news
for app developers, especially for those making professional apps and
games. While it will take some time for these new chips to roll out, we
can expect they’ll be everywhere within two years.

### macOS 11 at WWDC 2020

Aside from the new chips, the new version of macOS, known as Big Sur,
features a UI redesign. The redesign is in line with the updates I
mentioned above with iOS and iPadOS (widgets, better navigation).
There’s also changes to Safari Web Extensions, allowing you to set when
and where an extension is used in Safari, as opposed to simply being
“on” all the time.

## After WWDC 2020, Privacy Policy Now A Must-Have

App developers now **must** include a privacy policy with their apps.
Additionally, Apple has gone to a lot of effort to make this clear and
concise. I think we can all agree that anything that makes our apps earn
more trust from users should always be a high priority.

Amongst other things, users will be able to set how precisely an app can
see their location. It will also be clearer how apps use different parts
of the hardware, such as the microphone or camera.

### iPadOS 14 also seeing some great new features

Much like iOS 14, iPadOS 14 is getting a few nice updates to its
features. The ones I think that are worth paying attention to include UI
improvements. Most importantly, these introduce sidebars that make the
interface navigation much easier to use (similar to macOS), as well as
the widgets included on the iPhone. There are also updates to the
platform’s LiDAR scanner, which will be helpful for those of developing
apps that need to measure distance. Lastly, Apple made a big improvement
to the Apple Pencil with Scribble. Scribble has the ability to convert
written notes to typed text and recognize basic drawn shapes. This could
be amazing for people, who prefer the tactile experience of writing by
hand, for notes or marking up documents quickly.

## With WWDC 2020, the future of Apple app development looks bright

WWDC is almost always an exciting event, and this year was no exception,
despite none of us being able to attend in person. There are some really
clear, intelligent changes coming to Apple and its platforms. These
changes are going to make building apps faster and easier. They will
also open us up to including some great functionality that we’ve never
had before.

## Is your app ready for these changes?

All of these announcements from WWDC 2020 mean things are changing for
how we develop or update apps for the Apple ecosystem. If you're ready
to explore what it will take to make your app idea a reality or to
