# Freelancing - How to Prepare and Get Started


Last week I spoke at the LaDev in Ann Arbor on what it takes to go out on your own as a freelancing software developer and entrepreneur. 


> Leo Dion of BrightDigit will discuss what should be done to get started as well as how what skills you can nurture to become a successful freelancer. We'll talk about what is needed to manage your money, your reputation, and your time. If you are thinking about freelancing or just curious about what freelancing involves you’ll want to check this out.


I have posted the slides as well as the video of the event which you can check out.
