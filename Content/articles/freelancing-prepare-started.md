Last week I spoke at the [LaDev in Ann
Arbor](https://www.meetup.com/ladevmi/events/256221529/) on what it
takes to go out on your own as a freelancing software developer and
entrepreneur. 

> Leo Dion of BrightDigit will discuss what should be done to get
> started as well as how what skills you can nurture to become a
> successful freelancer. We\'ll talk about what is needed to manage your
> money, your reputation, and your time. If you are thinking about
> freelancing or just curious about what freelancing involves you'll
> want to check this out.
