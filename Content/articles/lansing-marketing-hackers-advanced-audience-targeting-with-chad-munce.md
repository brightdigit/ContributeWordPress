# Lansing Marketing Hackers - Advanced Audience Targeting with Chad Munce


We are happy to have Chad Munce, Digital Sales Manager for Nexstar Media Group speak on Advanced Audience Targeting. This will be Wednesday, October 9th at Noon. Here are some details:






> The promise of using advanced targeting with your digital marketing efforts is to be a "no waste" media by only sending your message to those most likely to take action. Auto dealers know the minute you start your online search for a vehicle, and aggressively go after your business. As a small-medium size business, how can you compete? The good news is that it does not take a huge budget to be very effective when you are going after the low hanging fruit. This discussion will focus on the most effective ways to target your most valuable customers.Advanced Audience Targeting with Chad Munce
