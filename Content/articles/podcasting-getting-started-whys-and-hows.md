Leo Dion recently did a talk at Lansing Marketing Hackers on podcasting
on how to get started.

In the talk, Leo covers the production of a podcast but also the
purpose:

> Podcasting may sound simple at first but to really be successful at it
> you need perseverance. Therefore, you need to really have a good
> reason and passion to do for a while. For this reason, rather than
> discussing **how to start podcast** let’s discuss the why.
