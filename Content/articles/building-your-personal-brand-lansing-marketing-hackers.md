# Building Your Personal Brand - Lansing Marketing Hackers


We had a great meetup last week thanks to Courtney! If you missed out, Paul from UnoDeuce Multimedia posted the video to our Youtube channel.



Slides for Courtney’s presentation can be found here.



If you are interested in learning more about managing your brand’s online presence, you’ll definitely want to check out Courtney’s 7-day email course.



Our next meetup is the Lunch and Chat on March 13th at Lansing Brewing Company. Our next presentation meetup is “Creating a New ‘Skill’ with Alexa” with Paul Schmidt on April 10th at the Fledge.
