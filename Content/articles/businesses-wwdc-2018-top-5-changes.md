This wasn't the "flashiest" year for WWDC but some important changes
were mentioned that affect businesses. It appears that Apple is
addressing concerns from the past year and doing some behind the scenes
house cleaning.Â These behind the scenes improvements might not grab the
headlines but they make a big difference for users and businesses.

# An iOS Update For Everyone

Both inside and outside the Apple world, lately there has been a fair
share of bad press and scandals. These reports are especially regarding
security issues, battery life, speed and bugs. As a result, this year
they have delivered the first update in awhile in which devices
supporting the previous OS support the update. That means all devices
which support iOS 11 can update to iOS 12:

#### iPhone

-   iPhoneÂ X
-   iPhoneÂ 8
-   iPhoneÂ 8Â Plus
-   iPhoneÂ 7
-   iPhoneÂ 7Â Plus
-   iPhoneÂ 6s
-   iPhoneÂ 6sÂ Plus
-   iPhoneÂ 6
-   iPhoneÂ 6Â Plus
-   iPhoneÂ SE
-   iPhoneÂ 5s

#### iPad

-   12.9-inch iPadÂ Pro 2nd generation
-   12.9-inch iPadÂ Pro 1st generation
-   10.5-inch iPadÂ Pro
-   9.7-inch iPadÂ Pro
-   iPad 6th generation
-   iPad 5th generation
-   iPadÂ AirÂ 2
-   iPadÂ Air
-   iPadÂ miniÂ 4
-   iPadÂ miniÂ 3
-   iPadÂ miniÂ 2

#### iPod

-   iPodÂ touch 6th generation

Additionally one piece of news that should make everyone happy is that
[older devices actually run faster with this
update.](https://bgr.com/2018/06/05/ios-12-vs-ios-11-speed-test-iphone-5s-iphone-8/)Â This
means if your company has older iPads, such as the iPad Air, or older
iPhones like the iPhone 5s or iPhone 6, it will probably be worth your
time to update your devices. **For developers, expect very high adoption
rates of iOS 12 and little reason to support iOS 11 for much longer.**

# Mac App Store Improvements

The Mac App Store has received its fair share of criticism. Compared
with its iOS counterpart, it has seemed neglected and insufficient for
the macOS software market. Apple has decided this year to make a bigger
push towards getting software developers onto the Mac App Store.

## Better Models ForÂ Businesses

Not only are they migrating the magazine format from the iOS App Store
over to the Mac but there are changes to the restrictions on apps and
their business model.

Recently,Â Apple has included a better subscription model. And now they
are including something like a "Free Trial" offering available from the
Mac App Store. There will also be improvements to how sandboxing works.
Sandboxing is a way to isolate the app and the files it uses from the
rest of the data on your computer.Â [This improvement to sandboxing has
allowed Mac developers at Panic to publish their app Transmit to the App
Store.](https://twitter.com/panic/status/1003767077256089600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1003767077256089600&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2018%2F06%2F04%2Fnew-sandboxing-improvements-bring-transmit-back-to-the-mac-app-store%2F)Â As
far as their pricing model, Panic will be doing a subscription model on
the App Store and allowing a one-time purchase on their website.

There are also other big software companies moving to the App Store,
such as Microsoft and Adobe.

Now is a good time to at least consider publishing your app to the mac.

# Using Social to Showcase AR

Since the release of the iPhone X and AR Kit, Apple has continued to
showcase it's AR features with Animoji and now Memoji. Animoji would use
a set of cute animated characters which mimic your facial expressions
using iPhone X technology. With iOS 12, Memoji allows a user to create
an animated version of themselves. It's easy to view this as a bit of a
gimmick. However, we must keep in mind what is going on "under the
hood." Memoji is a way to demo the exciting new AR and machine learning
technology behind it.Â

Businesses should continue to watch trends in ARKit and CoreML and
consider how these tools may help their business.

# Encouraging Productivity

Just as Google introduced new ways to control phone usage on Android,
Apple is doing the same on iOS 12 with Screen Time. Screen Time allows
users (and parents) to limit app and overall phone usage.

Users can always avoid following through on these limitations by
overriding them with a pass code. However, it's important for businesses
to keep in mind that users can place these limits on their apps.

# Plenty For BusinessesÂ to Prepare

In iOS 12, Apple has introduced Screen Time which encourages associating
the iPhone with productivity Â and less with addictive games and social
networking. Apple is also showing their commitment to older devices by
making them faster and more reliable in iOS 12. There is a strong
indication that Apple sees a big future in the Augmented Realty and
Machine Learning space as they introduce more features in ARKit, CoreML,
and Memojis.

On macOS, Apple is encouraging more developers to move to the Mac app
store. There are more improvements coming to the new version of macOS,
Mojave as well. We will talk about these in [our next
post](https://brightdigit.com/blog/2018/08/27/5-things-macos-mojave-developers/).
