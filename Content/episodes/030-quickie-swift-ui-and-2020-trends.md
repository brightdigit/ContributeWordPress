<li>Unlikely to see any big hardware innovations at this point</li>
<li>Maybe foldable</li>
<li>Great time to get an app on here, because it’s a mature product</li>
<li>11 not a huge change from the 10 (but definite upgrade from the 8)</li>
</ul><p><b>Apple Watch Innovation</b></p><ul>
<li>Waiting for some improvements to battery and processor, but this is about to become an amazing product</li>
<li>Great time to think about developing an app, esp. in the health &amp; fitness sector</li>
</ul><p><b>iPads and the Pro App Market</b></p><ul>
<li>Apple Arcade shows Apple is interested in a subscription/bundle for games</li>
<li>Highlighted new iPad but where are the serious pro apps</li>
<li>Why having a subscription for app/games is great</li>
<li>Hardware is great, but software needs to improve app ecosystem</li>
<li>The App store eco system is still setup for “casual” apps for there is potent</li>
</ul><p><b>Swift UI</b></p><ul>
<li>SwiftUI is changing the way UI is developed but slowly</li>
<li>First Swift-only API (no Objective-C compatibility)</li>
<li>Maybe not be ideal for some companies with different design patterns but it’s a better starting place then Storyboards and UIKit</li>
<li>Cross-Platform compatible with iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS</li>
