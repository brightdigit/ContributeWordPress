Leo’s technical expertise in developing iOS apps and his wonderful collaboration with our development team helped us achieve the sprint goals and build the iOS app features in time for the launch. As a scrum master on this native App project, I was particularly impressed by Leo's commitment towards completing features planned for sprint on time with great quality and his clear & concise communication on progress. Leo surely exceeded our expectations and I look forward working with Leo again in the future.",
