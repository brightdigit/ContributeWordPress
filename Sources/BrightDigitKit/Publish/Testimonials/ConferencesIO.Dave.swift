    fullQuote: "I'm glad I came across someone as talented and experienced as Leo. Over the last year, Leo has consulted and led my company's Mac App development efforts, building something our customers have been requesting for a long time. I have particularly been impressed by Leo's communication — he keeps a regular flow of updates coming, and anytime I have had a deep, wandering technical question, Leo has provided a clear and direct answer. Leo has also taken the time to learn about my company's customers, helping to brainstorm ideas for our Mac software as well as future iOS solutions. Any team looking for a high-level Mac and iOS developer would be lucky to work with Leo.",
