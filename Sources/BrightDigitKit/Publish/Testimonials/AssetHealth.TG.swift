    fullQuote: "We contracted Leo to help build our iOS app. The deadline was tight and he developed the features with impressive speed. He has thorough knowledge of all aspects of building a native app, from UI/UX design to API development and consumption. The thing that impressed me the most about Leo was his flexibility and understanding of the complexities of a large project, especially when requirements are not always well defined or when changing requirements causes rework. We hope to work with Leo again in the future!"
