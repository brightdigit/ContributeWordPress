    fullQuote: "Working with BrightDigit was a breeze. Our project had a tight timeline and required collaboration with another vendor and internal staff. Leo is proactive, responsive and friendly. The final deliverable was exactly what I wanted. If you are looking for a vendor with a nice blend of technical, social and project management skills, I highly recommend Leo at BrightDigit."
