      ### Livestream Your Health Stats Straight From Your Apple Watch

      Heartwitch is a combination Apple Watch and Web App for sharing your health data online.

      Video game live streaming has become a mainstream form of entertainment, with viewers liking to see how streamers behave and react to gameplay. With Heartwitch, viewers can see how the streamer reacts on a physical level.

      See the streamerâ€™s heart rate shift when hiding from a monster, driving a racecar around a tight bend, or as their favorite character dies in their arms.

      Unlike other apps that capture user health data, there is no need for extra hardware. It uses the built-in sensors of the Apple Watch to detect your heart rate and send it through our servers directly to your web browser.
