**ContributeWordPress** provides an easy to use API for importing a **WordPress** site into **Publish**.

## Overview

![Logo](ContributeWordPressLogo-DocC.png)

### Requirements 

**Apple Platforms**

- Xcode 14.3.1 or later
- Swift 5.8 or later
- iOS 14 / watchOS 7 / tvOS 14 / macOS 12 or later deployment targets

**Linux**

- Ubuntu 18.04 or later
- Swift 5.8 or later

### Installation

Use the Swift Package Manager to install this library via the repository url:

```
https://github.com/brightdigit/ContributeWordPress.git
```

Use version up to `1.0.0`.

### How It Works

**ContributeWordPress** uses the exported XML (also referred to as WXR file) to import content into your existing **Publish** site. 

```swift
import ContributeWordPress

let fromURL = URL(
    fileURLWithPath: "directory/containing/your/export/xml/files"
)
let toURL = URL(
    fileURLWithPath: "Path/to/Publish/root"
)

try MarkdownProcessor.beginImport(
    from: fromURL, 
    to: toURL
)
```

In order to begin, you need:

* The exported **XML file** 
* The active WordPress site or a complete download of the site's files (for the images on your site)

### Exporting from WordPress

**ContributeWordPress** needs a backup XML file from your **WordPress** site. To do this:

1. Login to your WordPress Administration Dashboard.
2. Go to Tools... Export:
![WordPress-Tools...Export](tools-export-download-file.png)
3. Download your export file by:
    * Clicking the Export All button (if you have a site without plugins installed.)
    * Selecting all content and clicking the Download Export File button (if you have a site with plugins installed.)
    * Download specific content only, like posts, pages, or feedback.
4. You will receive a .zip file to save to your computer with the .xml file inside of it. This file contains your posts, pages, comments, categories, tags, and references to your siteâ€™s images.

Larger sites will include more than one XML file to ensure that your export process will be fast and complete successfully, for instance if you are running multi-site **WordPress**. Luckily **ContributeWordPress** supports importing multiple xml files! 

When importing the BrightDigit website, the content was importing for the learningswift.brightdigit.com into brightdigit.com/tutorials and brightdigit.com into brightdigit.com/articles.

For more details on the export process, please read [the documentation on the **WordPress** site.](https://wordpress.com/support/export/)

### Getting Started

Besides exporting your **WordPress site**, you need access to the images by either:
* downloading directly from the site
* having a copy of the site's files

![Example Copy of the WordPress Site's Files](wordpress-site-files.png "Example Copy of the WordPress Site's Files")

Once you have both components, [you need to setup a **Publish** site]((https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish)). There are several great tutorials online:

* [JohnSundell/Publish: A static site generator for Swift developers](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish)
* [How to Create a Personal Website in Swift using Publish | Danijela's blog](https://www.danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/06/create-portfolio-website-using-publish/)
* [Static Site Generation with Swift using Publish, Plot and Ink](https://www.createwithswift.com/static-site-generation-with-swift-using-publish/)
* [Getting started with static-site generation in Swift using Publish | Andy Regensky](https://andyregensky.dev/articles/publish-getting-started/)

Once the site is setup, we can:

* convert and translate the HTML inside your exported XML (also referred to as WXR file) to Markdown files inside your _Content_ directory
* download (or copy) your images and other files inside your WordPress upload folder to your _Resources_ directory

### Exporting to Publish

The simplest way to import your **WordPress** site is by just passing the path to your xml files as well as the root of your **Publish** site.

```swift
import ContributeWordPress

let fromURL = URL(
    fileURLWithPath: "directory/containing/your/export/xml/files"
)
let toURL = URL(
    fileURLWithPath: "Path/to/Publish/root"
)

try MarkdownProcessor.beginImport(
    from: fromURL, 
    to: toURL
)
```

If you wish to create a small command line application you can take in command line arguments for the two paths:

```swift
import ContributeWordPress

let fromURL : URL
let toURL : URL

guard CommandLine.arguments.count == 2 else {
  exit(1)
}

fromURL = .init(fileURLWithPath: CommandLine.arguments[0])
toURL = .init(fileURLWithPath: CommandLine.arguments[1])

try! MarkdownProcessor.beginImport(from: fromURL, to: toURL)
```

### Dowloading Resources from Active Site

By default, **ContributeWordPress** will download the images from your active **WordPress** site. Therefore if it comes across a reference to url to your site it will change the url to the new address it will be imported to.

Therefore HTML from your exports file will change from:

```html
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://leogdion.name/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-e1547230562842-1024x682.jpg" alt="A JavaScript Meetup I hosted in 2018 " class="wp-image-105"/><figcaption>A JavaScript Meetup I hosted in 2018 </figcaption></figure>
```

to this in your markdown file:

```html
<figure class="wp-block-image">
<img
src="/media/wp-assets/default/2019/01/image-e1547230562842-1024x682.jpg"
class="wp-image-105" alt="A JavaScript Meetup I hosted in 2018 " />
<figcaption>A JavaScript Meetup I hosted in 2018</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Copy Resources from Local Backup


If your site is no longer active but you have a local copy of the site, you can pass in that directory to be used instead.

Let's expand on our previous command line example by adding an optional parameter:

```swift
let fromURL : URL
let toURL : URL

let importAssetsSetting : AssetImportSetting

guard CommandLine.arguments.count >= 2 else {
  exit(1)
}

fromURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: CommandLine.arguments[0])
toURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: CommandLine.arguments[1])

// if a third argument is passed
if CommandLine.arguments.count > 2 {
  // assume they want to copy the resources directly
  importAssetsSetting = .copyFilesFrom(
    URL(fileURLWithPath: CommandLine.arguments[2])
  )
} else {
  // otherwise use the default `download` option
  importAssetsSetting = .download
}

try! MarkdownProcessor.beginImport(
  from: fromURL,
  to: toURL,
  importAssetsBy: importAssetsSetting
)

```

Therefore you can call:

```bash
> wpublish \
  directory/with/export/xml/files \
  Path/to/Publish/root \
  path/to/root/wordpress/files
```

The ``AssetImportSetting`` option contains three options:
* ``AssetImportSetting/none`` - don't do anything
* ``AssetImportSetting/download`` - download them from the WordPress site
* ``AssetImportSetting/copyFilesFrom(_:)`` - copy the files from a local mapped location

### Converting Posts to Markdown

By default, **ContributeWordPress** doesn't implement any specific method to convert HTML from your WordPress posts to markdown. 

However there are a few easy to use implementations as well the ability to plug in your own.

Specifically this can done by passing a `MarkdownGenerator` to the processor:

```swift
try! MarkdownProcessor.beginImport(
  from: fromURL,
  to: toURL,
  usingGenerator: // your `MarkdownGenerator` here,
  importAssetsBy: importAssetsSetting
)
```

`MarkdownGenerator` is a simple protocol from the **Contribute** base library which takes an HTML `String` and returns a new markdown `String`.

```swift
/// A protocol for generating Markdown from HTML.
public protocol MarkdownGenerator {
  /// Converts an HTML string to Markdown.
  ///
  /// - Parameter htmlString: The HTML string to convert.
  /// - Returns: The generated Markdown string.
  /// - Throws: An error if the conversion fails.
  func markdown(fromHTML htmlString: String) throws -> String
}
```

By default, we use the `PassthroughMarkdownGenerator` which does nothing. However you can implement your own or use `HTMLtoMarkdown` to pass in a closure.

### Using ShellOut and Pandoc for Markdown

If you wish to convert the HTML from your WordPress posts to Markdown, the recommended solution is to use the `PanddocMarkdownGenerator` included with the **Contribute** library. The `PanddocMarkdownGenerator` requires the **ShellOut** library to run an installation of **Pandoc**.

The recommended way to install **Pandoc** on your machine is via homebrew:

```bash
> brew install pandoc
```

Once **Pandoc** is installed, you can run the command as part of your import using **ShellOut**.

Here is a simple code snippet for using plugging in **ShellOut**:

```swift
extension PandocMarkdownGenerator {
  public static func defaultShellOut(to command: String, arguments: [String]) throws -> String {
    try ShellOut.shellOut(to: command, arguments: arguments)
  }
  
  public init (temporaryFile: @escaping (String) throws -> URL = Temporary.file(fromContent:)) {
    self.init(shellOut: Self.defaultShellOut(to:arguments:), temporaryFile: temporaryFile)
  }
}
```

From here we can now simply use the `PandocMarkdownGenerator` to convert our WordPress HTML to markdown:

```swift
try! MarkdownProcessor.beginImport(
  from: fromURL,
  to: toURL,
  usingGenerator: PandocMarkdownGenerator(),
  importAssetsBy: importAssetsSetting
)
```

### Filtering Posts

The export files from WordPress contain a plethora of information including non-published posts as well as non-post items. **By default, the import filters for only published posts.** These are set using the ``RegexKeyPostFilter`` type which takes in a `KeyPath` of a `WordPressPost` property with a `String` type from the `SyndiKit` library and a `NSRegularExpression`.

Here's the example for the default ``RegexKeyPostFilter`` items:

```swift
    [
        RegexKeyPostFilter(pattern: "post", keyPath: \.type),
        RegexKeyPostFilter(pattern: "publish", keyPath: \.status)
    ]
```

Additionally you can implement your own ``PostFilter`` of any kind and pass it in:

```swift
try! MarkdownProcessor.beginImport(
  from: fromURL,
  to: toURL,
  filteringPostsWith: // array of `PostFilter` items
  importAssetsBy: importAssetsSetting
)
```

### Redirecting Old URLs

If you are migrating from **WordPress** to a **Publish** site, probably need to redirect several old urls to you new site. This can be done by passing a ``RedirectFormatter``. This requires two methods to be implemented:

* ``RedirectFormatter/formatRedirects(_:)`` which takes a collection of `RedirectItem` object (i.e. old URL, new URL) and expects a single string which will be written out somehere.
* ``RedirectFormatter/redirectsURL(basedOnResourcesDirectoryURL:)`` which returns the url for the file which that `String` needs to be written.

By default no redirect file is exported so you'll need to supply your own if needed. Otherwise, only **Netlify** is supported via ``NetlifyRedirectFormatter``. More granular control is available via the ``RedirectFileWriter`` if needed. 

Feel free to post an issue or pull request for your own implementations or questions.

### Using SwiftArgumentParser for Settings

While you may wish the parse the arguments yourself using the `CommandLine` object, it is highly recommended you use the **Swift Argument Parser** for more complex options.
